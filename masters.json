This solution allows the people to take back control and gain independence from this broken and oppressive system. At the completion of each artwork, the current block height of bitcoin is inscribed somewhere in the piece. \"(un)limited\" is the first in the series.\n\nIn one state, you see the Fed Monkey injecting fiat into the system by simply painting words onto the wall using the only tools he knows, quantitative easing and bailouts. With his official federal reserve badge, he adds \"Millions\" \"Billions\" \"Trillions\" into the markets. None of it means anything, just writing bigger numbers on the wall until the ruling class approves. And the bailouts? Those keep getting bigger too. The bailout money is for corporations and their shareholders, not the working class. Maintaining the current System requires the rich get richer while the poor stay poor.\n\nIn another state, the previously black and white background has been colored in, while the \"Millions\" \"Billions\" \"Trillions\" has faded. The girl, wearing a protective bitcoin gas mask, provides a solution to the broken system. She paints directly over the quantitative easing and bailouts, with the number \"21 million.\" This number symbolizes the hard-capped supply of bitcoin. To show the unchangeable nature of these 21 million bitcoin, she mounts an unbreakable piece of glass directly over her painting. The message is clear, opt out and start stacking sats.",

The news is flooded with reports of things which are hitherto unheard of. The situation is particularly worse for a part of society - the creators. The creators - the artists, the artisans, the craftsmen, the street-side sellers of handicrafts, each of them have faced the wrath of the pandemic. It has gotten so worse, that they have started consuming their own produce. The hungry sweet-maker started eating his own sweets. In the dearth of clothing, they started wearing their own handmade fabrics. Thus, this vicious circle of the “creator consuming the creation” has started. “In Other News” is an artwork, an outcry from all these invisible members of the society, who are usually neglected by regular media. It tries to throw light at their situation and tries to say - we also exist.\nI photographed each of these photographs as part of an exhibition 5 years back in Hyderabad, showing how the creator consumes his creation. I found this the right time to use these photographs to show the situation of these people whom we see and ignore in everyday life. The innate evil underlying this tendency was symbolised by the 10 heads of the evil king Ravana. The head in each photograph tilts slightly from left to right, image to image - thus showcasing the 10-headed Ravana, with the Photographer at the centre. There are only 9 images in the artwork. The 10th head is invisible, which is me myself as the artist. I will be buying one of the pieces of my creation and thus completing this circle.",

Sands of time continued to fall; with each grain, a small part of their soul faded. A battle was being fought in their minds, the prize: continued life. They turned to meditation in an effort to strengthen their spirit.

Regardless of skill levels, anyone can make amazing creations because of the use of symmetry. \n\nThe interactive artwork is at : https://nurecas.github.io/regalia/ . By clicking/tapping and drawing around the insignia different symmetrical patterns can be created. The final artwork can be downloaded by pressing enter/return key. Also, this page is linked to the layers of Regalia, i.e. based on the states of the different layers, the colour palette of the artwork, the central insignia, the planes of symmetry and the brush size changes. Thus, the owner of each layer controls the look and feel of the artwork and its creation process. \n\nI believe that a true artist starts by creating/curating his tools of creation. In the same spirit, many of my works hitherto have been on creating tools, digital or otherwise, and then using those tools to create art. Regalia is also created with the same concept in mind.",

This much we know. Some say once cats were worshipped as gods, but I say, any god gets his balls cut off, ain't no kind of god at all. Out of that era we hear only the howling songs yowled in the early years of cat cognition. And the Pixel Records dug from the endless chains and remants of the Virtual Multitude, still running to this day on DeCentral Station, a dangerous Multiverse of endless reflection plasma-gapped from the Global Grid. These days there's tension in the Double Māo. Kitty God's Army units openly patrolling the streets, Short-cats on the scene looking for answers, Marlene can barely feed her kittens, Ol' Mangey's on the moloko again. I even heard a rumor the Amigos are expanding their territory. It's like you need 10 lives just to survive in this town. We all feel it. This city is filled with fear and that fear has a name. Kung Paw. Once the Elite Guards, by claw and fang they cut through all opposition to their Emperor's terrible will, until the night his Majesty's kitcubine slipped on the raised dias, and their agile Captain Aditi caught her mid-fall. Though he kept her paw from touching the ground and preserved her honor, his own paws had broken the deepest taboo and by the Emperor's own decree - the punishment was death. In a moment of weakness or love, the Emperor commuted the sentence to exile. Enraged their leader was denied an honorable death, the Kung Paw slaughtered the Emperor in dark memorial and fled into exile to search for their Master, making way for the popular uprising that swept the city, and this uneasy peace that's descended. It was rumored that the Kung Paw found their leader in a great cavern underground in the wastes of the West, performing arcane rituals to seek forbidden power. These days I don't know what to believe... Pray the Eyes of the Kitty God are upon us now, my kitties. Look to the East and Shao Mountain. Surely righteous cats still walk this domain.",

      "description": "Sometimes, things happen by chance or coincidence. During the lockdown of the Covid-19 pandemic, I’ve experimented with textures, colors, and optical effects - and an AI software. The aim of this optical study was to see what sensations it could provoke and explore the state of “controlled confusion” it could create, while keeping it simple.\nOne of the first results of my optical experimentation is this Digital Device. Starting from single lines of various thicknesses, I played with repetition and chromatic clashes, soon realizing these very simple elements could open infinite possibilities and generate countless patterns: the experiment could not be interrupted.\nWhile thinking back at Bruno Munari and the Italian season of Arte Programmata (programmed art) of the 1960s, I looked at the programmable future of it, finding in Async the perfect solution for keeping my artistic exploration and this historical movement alive. Only this time it is the collectors who can play the creator’s part, having the chance to write a new page in the history of programmable art.\nTo learn more about the creative process and the relevance of this Digital Device in relation to the tradition of Arte Programmata you can check out the brief manual at http://www.mattiac.it/mattiac_dd1_async.pdf",

The final generative artwork rests at https://nurecas.github.io/chromology/ . The link takes you to a blank canvas. Use your mouse or touch to start drawing and playing with colours. The concept of the artwork was to break away from set forms, and engage in creations which are abstract in nature. In this way, the artwork is intended for \"play\" as opposed to \"make\". There are 4 styles of creations controlled by the \"Expression\" layer. There are 5 colour themes controlled by the \"Theme\" layer.  I believe that a true artist starts by creating/curating his tools of creation. In the same spirit, many of my works hitherto have been on creating tools, digital or otherwise, and then using those tools to create art. Chromology is also created with the same concept in mind.",

This piece is also an invitation to meditate on the role of \"value\" throught the ages and how it's been radically altered by the coming into existence of technologies and concepts like cryptocurrencies and digital scarcity.",

      "description": "Welcome to the ‘Beautiful worlds’ where nature and technology have merged into a single entity. These are Ai generated and hand finished visions of solarpunk future in which I would really like our future generations to live and prosper: the future we might have if we took the very “alternative route” which now lies before us: replacing states and corporations which free federations of communities and cooperatives, using decentralist and ecological technologies to create a world beyond economic scarcity and social hierarchy, defined by autonomy, mutual aid, diversity, and inclusiveness. The long-term goals of solarpunk are freedom and well-being for all by adopting and developing such ecological technologies as: solar, wind, wave and geothermal energy rather than oil or gas to generate electricity; a world of decentralized eco-cities, permaculture and vertical farming, free and open-source software, open-source hardware, small-scale fabrication laboratories, micro-manufacturing, 3D-printing, and countless examples of commons-based peer-production online: meeting the maximum amount of needs, in the shortest time, using the minimum possible amount of energy. It’s a world of decentralized and confederated eco-communities, using technology for human-centric and eco-centric ends rather than for accumulating power and profit – mending the metabolic rift between first nature (the natural world) and second nature (human culture) – and where social hierarchies of race, gender, sexuality, and disability are considered horror stories from the past “oil age”. Solarpunk desires societies of polycultural ethnic diversity and gender liberation, where each person is able to actualize themselves in societal environment of free experimentation and communal caring; This philosophy proposes that in order for the social and natural worlds to reconcile, humans must first transform their relations to each other – recreating society along egalitarian, cooperative, and democratic lines – and then transform their relations towards nature – adopting an attitude to cooperation, rather than domination, towards the planet and its nonhuman forms of life. Text by Connor Owens.\r\nThis artwork took me a year to create and for you it will take a year to discover. \r\nMaster autonomously updates once a day at 12am with one of 366 original artworks.\r\nEnjoy!",

Often they also met in virtual rooms of Cryptovoxels, Decentraland, Somnium Space or Sandbox to create new inventions, read books about new technologies, or just swing the brushes. But on this day something gigantic happened. A good friend of Leo came to visit and brought his girlfriend Mona, who wanted a piece of Leo's art on her skin. This was the birth of the NFT's, as Leo developed Non Fungible Tattoos in the Block Chain Dungeon of Michel and Angelo. From that day on people from all over the world came to get NFT's from Leo or one of his students, like \"Skeenee the rat\", who controls the NFT machine with his laptop. A new age began.",

      "description": "我创作的灵感源于生活，在日常中观察、体会、转化成我的艺术观念。研读中国古典哲学经典能让我辩证地去思考、看待各种疑问，包括在艺术上的。一个全新的文化环境对人会产生很大的影响，让我认识到个体是很难完全从自身的固有文化中逃离出来，这种根深蒂固的烙印不仅源于家庭还有社会、历史的影响。古老文明的延续、推陈出新与当今世界不可避免地面对多元文化的碰撞与交融，人类文明的发展不正是在这种似有似无的规律下演变而来的吗！我尝试着不把多文化的冲撞当作是一种冲突，而是多文明融合的过程。万物相辅相成，在冲撞中取得平衡，一切均离不开“变”。在我的作品中，抱着这样的思索与感悟去探寻摄影创作的各种可能性，实验1号作品正是这么产生的。\n\nThe inspirations of my creation derive from life. I observe, experience, and transform it into my artistic concepts in daily life. Studying classic Chinese philosophical text allows me to think and regard dialectically to all kinds of questions, including those in art. A brand-new cultural environment will significantly impact people, making me realize that it is difficult for individuals to completely detach from their own inherent culture. This ingrained imprint not only stems from families but also social and historical influences. The continuation and innovation of the ancient civilization and today's world inevitably faces the collision and integration of multiple cultures. Didn’t the development of human civilization evolve under the indistinct ways? I try not to treat the clashes from multicultural as a kind of conflict, but a multi-civilization integration process. All things complement each other and balance in the collision. \"Changes\" is the key. In my artworks, I'm carrying this kind of thinking and comprehending to explore the various possibilities of photography creations. The series of Experiment No.1 is precisely how it came about.",

      "description": "Millions of years ago a race existed called the \"M\" (pronounced 'mmm') on Earth. They evolved over many years and transcended variance of time and space. They reached a stage of evolution where all of time and space was accessible instantly to them. This is when they invested in simulations and creating a new type of intelligence. At first, these were systems to help the M's work. But this intelligence evolved into what later became known as humankind. It so happened that the intelligence progressed high enough to replace the M's on Earth, while the M's transcended completely into another dimension. \nRemnants of the M's are still seen in humankind. For example, humans were created in a form similar to that of the M's. Also, the sound that humans can make with their mouths closed, is the M sound. The interesting thing is that millions of years later, because of the fractal nature of the universe, humanity is in the verge of creating \"artificial intelligence\" which could potentially become sentient and replace them, just like how the M's were replaced by humans.\nAlthough in the alternate dimension, some of the M's still stay back at the key energy centres of the earth. Across 9 locations around the globe, these energy centres have, over the years, evolved into prime cultural centres on Earth.\nAnd now it is up to us to travel to these centres to meet them and understand the secrets of the past.\nPilgrimage is an artwork comprising of a series of 9 3D models, which are distributed across 9 locations around the globe. These 9 models can be unlocked only by travelling to the place and opening https://nurecas.github.io/pilgrimage . The first person to reach a place, unlock a model and share the video of the model will be rewarded with the NFT of that model. The final artwork of Pilgrimage rests in Async.Art as a Master and one layer: The Master of the artwork will have the reference to the source code, all 9 3D models and other assets in the artwork. The layer will be used to switch to the image of each model as each of it is unlocked. This only layer will be rewarded to the first collector of the Master.

Claimed territory exerts faint influence over adjacent tiles until they reach full opacity.   You may endeavour to grow a single chosen colour hex code across the continent as if it were an expanding empire, with each new tile bolstering the values of the last.  You might also choose to blend your layers together to better represent peaceful coexistence and the  cross-pollination of ideas, or collaborate with other owners to promote unity across the region.  Or, you could focus on the artwork itself - mixing primary colours together regardless of geography or history to achieve a greater aesthetic purpose.  Finally, layers have the additional option of being left intentionally blank. You may wish to preserve the painting underneath, or simply leave the land as you discovered it.",

Over the course of months, gathering in a back alley of a digital megalopolis, we typed columns of words about philosophy, symbolism and identity, Bruce Lee and King’s Cross, poetry, the I Ching, Ancient Kemet... We typed our frustrations and joys and obsessions at each other. Time passed. Time is still passing – and meanwhile we weave together our experience living walled off from the world we could touch, creating from our reciprocal estrangement this ever-shifting tapestry.",

      "description": "A host of things happened to me over the last few years. There were extremities of happiness and sadness. By and large as I evolved I came to question not what I did right or wrong, but what in-fact is right and wrong. What is this duality of forces. They say they are just two sides of a coin, but what is it really to understand that. 2 years back I had some clarity on this. It is not something verbally explainable. But an experience where the division of the opposites merged into unity. And thus I realised the subjective experience of division and the movement to unity. \r\nI tried to play with the emotional relations of the audience with this work at a subtler level - not trying to induce the obvious happy-scare emotions, but experiences at a more visceral level. Made with freely available stock materials, the artworks were composed and rendered to create imagery that asks the question : \"What is right and wrong?\"",

      "description": "We live in times where New Aesthetic and New Media are the rule of our visual code. My creative process appropriates the characteristic visual features of the main movements present in digital art in recent years—such as Glitch Art, 3D models, DataViz, Code Art, Vaporwave and Cyberpunk, in order to mix them with each other and reintegrate them with traditional media such as drawing and painting. As a painter by training, I conduct myself through an erratic process that seems more like a search for a personal aesthetic within the density of images and information characteristic of our era.\nCompose obsessively is the key to associating these elements in an image; distribute visual weights, observe the piece at a different distance, move away and get closer. Neural Alchemy is the result of cautious curation of elements and careful observation and decision-making to solve a piece that is not meant to be static. As an artist, producing an image for the format in which Async Art works is one of the most exhilaratingly creative challenges I have ever faced.\nThe piece is made up of four layers based on the core elements: Mood, Material Color, Ethereal Color and Body Matter. Each one plays with references of the styles mentioned above. Hope you find hidden messages and feel inspired by this creation, you might enjoy this piece as much as I do.",

      "name": "The Quiet of Silence... Triptych (Wabi-Sabi)",
      "description": "This Art Piece is based on the original Triptych made from the photographs I took around Lake Ashinoko (Japan, 芦ノ湖) and is the first NTF artwork that belongs to the series \"WABI-SABI: Acceptance of Transience... the Beauty of things that are Imperfect, Impermanent, Incomplete\".\r\n \r\nI spent nearly 3 months around Japan trying to understand a very profound and rooted Japanese philosophy and way of life that goes back many centuries… that of Wabi-Sabi. Wabi-Sabi is the quintessential Japanese aesthetic. It is the beauty of things that are imperfect, impermanent, and incomplete. It is the beauty of things that are modest and humble. It is the beauty of things that are unconventional… of everyday things… man-made, natural and the union of the two. \r\nThe series was started in 2014-2015 and is still an ongoing project.\r\n\r\nWHY MAKE IT INTO A NFT ART PIECE?\r\nWith the possibilities offered by AsyncArt and NFTs I decided to \"extend\" the original Triptych by changing some elements from the 3 original photos with other elements... this gave me more possibilities, more flexibility and allowed me to complete the original concept of \"WABI-SABI: Acceptance of Transience... the Beauty of things that are Imperfect, Impermanent, Incomplete\".\r\nIMPORTANT: Every element in each layer/state comes from one of the original photographs (about 1000) that I took on the same location (Lake Ashinoko, Japan). This is essential, because all the parts of this NFT artwork are relevant to the same place and not \"abstract\" insertions from non related images. I wanted everything to be in harmony.\r\n\r\nThis NFT piece is composed by 3 Layers. Each layer has 6 States which can be changed by the owner of the layer and will reflect on the Master. This creates a total of 216 possible combinations. You can see an animation + all the different combinations here: www.tonycorocher.com/nft-triptych/\r\n\r\nThe Cover Image of each layer (the image that the owner of the layer will see as his/her own art piece) is one of the 3 original photos that make up the original printed Triptych. \r\n\r\nThe original Triptych does NOT come from one photograph split into 3 pieces, but from 3 different photos taken from different positions and with different perspectives. The final piece was first imagined in the head and later on put together as a composition.\r\nThe original Triptych is also available as a Fine Art Print (all my photos are printed in 1 unique copy + a Limited Edition of 12).  \r\n\r\nWHAT DOES WABI-SABI MEAN?\r\nWABI: Beauty in simplicity.\r\nWabi is the austere beauty found in simple, even stark, things. The concept emerged as part of the tea ceremony in the 15th century. Over time it moved beyond physical objects like simple tea implements to merge with Zen and become a life philosophy based on rejecting anything showy or wasteful. Wabi can also be enjoyed in observing the changing seasons while reflecting on the impermanence of things.\r\n\r\nSABI: Beauty in decay.\r\nSabi is the beauty of things that are old and in a state of decay. For example, one might see Sabi in the worn grain of the polished wood of the corridors in an old Japanese house; an old statue of the Buddha, the gold lacquer peeled off to reveal the bare wood beneath; or moss covered rocks in the garden.\r\n\r\nWabi-Sabi (侘寂?) represents a comprehensive Japanese world view or aesthetic centered on the acceptance of transience and imperfection. It is a concept derived from the Buddhist teaching of the three marks of existence (三法印 sanbōin?), specifically impermanence (無常 mujō?), the other two being suffering (苦 ku?) and emptiness or absence of self-nature (空 kū?).\r\n\r\nCharacteristics of the Wabi-Sabi aesthetic include asperity (roughness or irregularity), simplicity, economy, austerity, modesty, intimacy, and appreciation of the ingenuous integrity of natural objects and processes.\r\n\r\n----------------------\r\nABOUT ME:\r\nInternational Award winning independent Documentary & Fine Art Photographer.

I want this piece to become a reflection of the collector's emotional state instead of reflecting mine. That being said, I hope to see the \"Joy layer state\" a lot, and maybe if you are feeling sad I can help you with that. :)\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nHorus",

They share a studio in Haarlem, the Netherlands,  where they found mutual artistic ground.\r\n\r\n“The Jackpot” is loosely based on William Gibson's book “The Peripheral”. It's about two timelines, set apart 70 years, on different continents. These timelines converge and characters on both sides of  time find themselves interacting, strategizing and plotting to ward off a greater danger, called the jackpot.\r\n\r\nYtje Veenstra is a longtime fan of Gibson's cyberpunk and speculative fiction. Her clear-lined drawings intersect and merge with Rutger van der Tas' mind bending, psychedelic style. Like the two timelines in Gibson's story, Rutger and Ytje weave their art and vision into an organic, yet collage-like dream world, a universe where future nightmares and virtual worlds fold in around themselves.",

Even though the elements remain the same, each month there's a new scene manifesting changes related to a certain month; wether by reason (the known angles of the sun on specific times for ex.) or emotion (the use of a symbolic colour to express a season), the scene is always changing in accordance to an idealized seasonal cycle (taking place in a temperate climate of the northern hemisphere.)\n\nThe images change at the 21st of each month, and during each season the camera focus will incide on one of the elements: an egg for the Winter Solstice and a skull for the Summer Solstice, while the Equinoxes are marked by a focus on the idol standing in between them. \n\nIt's a still life, but also a meta-shrine that connects us to another form of time.",

She's named The Lion Faced One because she painted the image of a lion on her space helmet when she was younger. This character resonated with me on a personal level. She reminded me of my grandmother, who passed away in 2020. Being 98, she experienced WWII. When our country was occupied by the nazis, she smuggled weapons and and supplies past German checkpoints,. She was pretty fearless and practical to a fault, just like Eunice Akinya.\r\nThe source material reflects my own ideas. It challenged me to imagine how I would envision a future world, while anchoring it firmly to classical concepts in art, like landscapes and portraits. ",

With each turn there was a new opening, a separate path leading to a magical monolith. \r\n\r\nSo many possibilities...\r\n\r\nThe hero felt lost, unsure where to go, knowing that each monolith provided different blessings and strengths. She took her time, examining all of the choices thoroughly- She could always use more knowledge, protection and fortune, but maybe she craved for a meaningful connection and some additional courage. This was a difficult choice, but there was no wrong choice, which gave her comfort.\r\n\r\nIn the end she let her instinct choose, what felt right for her. As she approached the Monolith, she felt the magic radiating from it washed over her. \r\n\r\nThe backgrounds represent our past, where we come from. The cloaks symbolize the present moment, they're the insulation from the outside world. The protection and comfort, giving us the strength to keep going. Whereas, Monoliths represent the future, they can be considered more like magical charms to aid us in our pursuits. Each monolith has it's own meaning and purpose.\r\n\r\nThe symbols in the art can be transcribed into English words revealing the deeper meanings in the artwork and combinations. The symbols' key is located on the cloaks preview layer.\r\n\r\nThis painting is a part of the Adventure series, a journey about discovery, persistence and perseverance. This project is quite personal but I keep the meanings vague enough for others to find their own interpretations and connection to the art.",

Enjoying and being grateful for the journey itself is part of the dream, and ascending too high just means that there can ultimately be an even larger fall to the bottom.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\nDETAILS:\r\n•Layers: 34 Background Layers, 12 Middle Layers, 20 Top Layers\r\n•Resolution: 1620x2160 (Async), 5400x7200 (High Res)\r\n•Medium: Multimedia, Programmable\r\n•Software: Tilt Brush, Cinema 4D, Octane Render, Substance Painter, ProCreate, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop\r\n•Physical Canvas/Prints: If they so choose, the original buyer of the Master Layer can get in touch with me on social media to have a free physical 18\"x24\" Canvas Print or Fine Art Print sent to their address of choice.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\nPROCESS:\r\nThis piece was created with an intention to use as many of my different creative skills / software knowledge as possible, while also iterating on years and years of personal aesthetic research and design theory. The first step involved sculpting the base mesh, rigging the model, splitting out the designated sections/pieces of the body, and then resuming sculpting and detail using VR & Tilt Brush. From VR, the 3D model was taken back and cleaned up in Cinema 4D and textured externally in Substance Painter. Once the model and texturing was to my liking, I consolidated my textures and set up my render scene/lighting using Octane Render in C4D. I exported a 2D still that I could paint and embellish with the floral pattern tattooed on the model's body. The still render was then hand-painted using my iPad/Procreate. The final step included me creating alternate background layers, hair/wire layers, and skin layers using bits and pieces from the previous processes. All the variants and pieces were composited in Photoshop, tweaked, color corrected, and styled to create the final composition consisting of 34 background layers, 13 mid ground layers, and 20 foreground layers.",

      "description": "Rock paper scissors is a simple little game we played as kids; whether to pass time or to call dibs on the bigger slice of pie. Under the hood, it’s a rudimentary and confrontational form of communication; three words caught in a triangular relationship of domination and submission.\r\n\r\nA closed fist represents rock: heavy, solid, and capable of crushing scissors. An extended index and middle finger resemble scissors: sharp, sophisticated, and destined to cut paper. An open palm mimics paper: candid, transparent, and clever enough to bind rock. The only moment of truce is when matching gestures are thrown; a brief release of tension and glimpse into a mirror. \r\n\r\nMore could be said with the three expressions. A closed fist is handing a concealed gift to an open palm; the extended index and middle fingers are calling for peace. The relationship doesn’t need to be contentious.\r\n\r\n‘Rock Paper Scissors’ frames an ongoing conversation between two strangers. Limited to three signals, the strangers may decide whether their dialog is a never-ending chase for power, a mutual armistice, or something deeper altogether.\r\n\r\nA third participant narrates my own relationship with my hands. As an artist, my hands mean the world to me - they allow me to express my thoughts and materialize my imagination. Perhaps a cosmic joke, my hands suffer from chronic eczema. Whenever I create art, my hands become fragile, dry husks – as though I channel life from my hands into the work. Despite all this, I choose my art to be about joy and play. In the end, it’s a fun little game.",

Not a single source from any original art is used to create these paintings. Used NASA's public collection of Hubble telescope cosmos images.

Just to get philosophical, As we have not yet figured out what conscious itself is, then how can we define what art should be.\r\n​\r\nAlso a unique opportunity when you need to think about parametric form with unusual physics which cannot exist in reality, this is where machine intelligence services you with power of exploring unusual and other-worldly forms and experiences.

Following my creative passion, I started to learn digital techniques back in 2010 and worked as a graphic designer for a decade. In 2019 I decided to share my personal work and emotions with a wider audience via social medial channels which served as the foundation of a contemporary visual project called Dformer.  The positive welcome from the people was incredible to me as a result my work was featured 250+ times on curator pages. In my opinion, my biggest achievement so far that some of my works got exhibited in Madrid last year. \r\n\r\nThe digital version of the exhibition is still available here:\r\nhttps://supercorp.work/virtual-gallery\r\n\r\n\r\nABOUT THE ARTWORK\r\n------\r\nI've been working on this artwork since 2019.

Made in January 2021.\r\n\r\nThis piece celebrates the baptism of my signature red bear, that until now, didn't have a name. Now his official name is Chico.\r\n\r\nI created Chico in 2017 and since then I've been asked about his name by almost everybody that has seen him. Sadly I never came up with a name that I thought could suit him well. In January 2021 the artist Brian Murphy, sculptor based in Boston MA, suggested the name Chico for the bear and I thought it suited him perfectly: it means \"small\" in Spanish, it gives him a cool Latin-American vibe and it also sounds cute to me.\r\n\r\nI decided to make Chico's baptism public using blockchain technology so it could be official.\r\n\r\nThe piece also contains a series of symbols I've been working with lately, like stars, sparkles and dripping clouds.\r\n\r\nThe layers can be changed to show different stages of the hearts, a regular red or a special golden version of Chico and also a colorful day or red night background (that hides an easter egg).\r\n\r\nYou can see more works here: https://www.jaime.works\r\n",

This means that THE LAYERS ARE NOT FOR SALE but will be delivered FREE OF CHARGE TO THE PERSON WHO COLLECTS THE MASTER. I decided to do this because the artwork was created to be in the hands of one collector and I would like him/her to have the ability to trigger changes to his/her liking.\r\n\r\n• TEST THE ARTWORK: before you decide to purchase, you can test and play around with the Master by triggering changes to the states of the Layers (3 Layers + 18 States = 216 possible combinations) by going to this link:\r\nhttps://www.tonycorocher.com/nft-digitalart/AsyncArt/testwabisabi04\r\n\r\n• EXTRA!!! A PHYSICAL PRINT: the owner of this artwork will also be eligible to receive a Museum Quality Fine Art Giclèe Print (70x40 cm) done using carbon pigmented inks on Hahnemühle Archival Paper of the highest quality. This will be a 1of1 Fine Art Print and a collectors item (with holograms, signature, date, stamps and paper certificates) in line with my 10 years selling museum quality prints. The special feature here is that the collector will be able to select the 3 States he/she likes more (one for each layer) and I will get that selection printed and sent to him/her. \r\nYou can find more info about my Fine Art Prints process here: https://www.tonycorocher.com/fine-art-prints/\r\n\r\n• DESCRIPTION: \r\nI loved Japan and its culture since I can remember… its aesthetic principles of beauty, its sense of peace, the respect for others, its harmony and safety. \r\n\r\nIn this artwork I want to present and describe (through a series of 18 interchangeable street photographs I took around Japan in 2 years) a feeling of detachment and kind of “self inflicted” loneliness which may seem very strange to a non Japanese or someone traveling to this beautiful country for the first time. This feeling can be encountered all over the country but is felt more strongly in the big cities, especially in the streets of Tokyo. \r\n\r\nA feeling that deeply entangles and mixes with a secular way of life, with a thought process and a value system based on respect, duty and obligation… all directed to achieve harmony and tranquility.\r\nTo most Japanese these are not just ideas to believe in, but almost “unmovable objects” that still linger in the further recesses of their “modern” minds.\r\nThese ideas may have changed their forms in the last century but they have also retained their influence and are frequently the main reason of misunderstanding with non Japanese people.\r\n\r\nThis NFT digital artwork is composed of 1 Master, 3 Layers and 18 states which can be triggered from the Layers to change the Master in 216 possible combinations. It is n.4 in the \"WabiSabi\" NFT Collection.",

However, a few possible identities have just emerged in 2021, 20 years since the development of the technology:\r\n\r\nPossible Identities:\r\n#10-1 The Elontoshi Muskamoto\r\nAs we shoot into the future, behind us is the history we leave behind.

On one hand--> from the league of extraordinary gentlemen comes the rise of a brilliant man who puts us into outer-space, has advanced electronic payment systems, revolutionized the electric car industry, launched the Falcon 9 Rocket to the international Space-Station with a billion-dollar contract with NASA.  The headlines read: \"Tesla Acquires 1.5 billion in Bitcoin\" -- (Source: CNBC, Feb 8th 2021)\r\n\".....I do at this point think Bitcoin is a good thing.  I'm late to the party, but I am a supporter of bitcoin.  .... However the comments on Dogecoin \"are meant to be jokes.... The most ironic outcome would be that Dogecoin becomes the currency of Earth in the future... said Musk\" (CNN)\r\n\r\nPossible Identity #10-2\r\nThe Kimatoto Jung-toshi\r\n  On the flip-side of the coin, a brutal dictator who will stop at nothing to grab power.  The headlines read: \"Finding Financing in Unlikely Places\" United Nations Experts sheds light on $316 million worth of Bitcoin amassed by North Korea (Nikkei Asian Review)\r\n\".....however, bitcoin is an effective tool for several reasons...... that is cut off from the modern financial system and has little access to hard currency, it is easy to understand why bitcoin is so appealing. It stands out as the perfect solution for the budding financial problems that are caused by years of disconnection from the global economy...... North Korea can effectively mine or steal bitcoin to support its economy and missile program.\" (Investpedia)\r\n\r\n  The future that is laid before us we must seek-out, for it is part of the human condition to journey and explore where no man has gone before.

The month is nearing its end, critical mass is growing bigger and bigger and on the last day of the month, they unmask him. Everybody leaves him and he is alone again. But not for a long. Shadows quickly forget and start to gather around him again.

The owner of the master will receive ownership over all three layers and will be able to customize the chip count by altering the colors of the poker plaques. White = $1,000, Yellow = $2,000, Pink = $5,000, Blue = $10,000, Purple = $100,000, Orange = $500,000, and Red = $1,000,000. Right now Bond has $2,000 pushed in, but it’s up to you to decide how much he has at stake in the next hand. And if for some reason Lady Luck isn’t on your side, well there’s nothing a Vesper martini can’t cure. Shaken, not stirred of course. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the master and all of the layers, the owner will receive the unique 1/1 framed polaroid set of the 12 original polaroids used to create this NFT.

Some of them are very well-known and some are up and coming.\r\n\r\nWe are all familiar with the famous painting and the composition of the original work by Rembrandt, therefore this digital piece is easily readable although it is a cacophony of styles and colors.\r\n\r\nRutger did not want to hold back the creativity by giving a set of rules. No themes, no color palette was assigned. Just the creative flow and the story every artist wanted to tell. They had to feel the freedom to do whatever they wanted.\r\n\r\nEvery artist was supplied with a figure or piece of the surroundings in the original painting. No one was able to pick a place, a spot or character on beforehand.\r\n\r\nAfter dividing the canvas into separate layers and giving them a number, an online randomizer was used to divide them. This was done three times to get three different options. After this, a vote was made to choose which of the three variations was going to be used. This was done in a special Nachtwacht Telegram group.\r\n\r\nAll artists involved worked hard on their contribution even though we have all been impacted by Covid-19 directly or indirectly.\r\n\r\nBeing in a lockdown or not free to move in the way we used too, makes this online NFT art community very important.

What if I told you that there are goddesses up above blessing us with their magical, stellar aura everyday? Do you believe in stellar goddesses? \r\n\r\nWith this piece, it will alternate between Stellar Goddess and Cosmic Consciousness depending on our actual time of day in the real world.\r\n\r\nABOUT THE ARTIST:\r\n\r\nMy name is Shaylin Wallace or Shay the Surrealist and this is my second tokenized NFT artwork! I specializes in creating surreal, yet minimal compositions by manipulating stock images using Adobe Photoshop. In 2014, I started editing images on apps such as PicsArt and Union App and overtime, I found my passion which is manipulating images in surrealistic ways. In 2017, I saved up enough money to purchase my very first laptop and soon after got an Adobe subscription and downloaded Photoshop! Since then, I have designed hundreds of unique photo-manipulations and many amazing series as well. Welcome to my Imagination.\r\nWarning: Your Mind May Be Blown Away!\r\n\r\nCheck out more of my artwork: https://www.smwvisuals.com/photo-manipulations \r\n\r\nThank you in advance if you collect this piece!\r\nShaylin Wallace | https://www.smwvisuals.com/ ",

The original oil painting is the night state of this programmable art piece, and it shows a crane from an UFO catcher machine.\r\nFor this piece I wanted to show a more story driven image, leaving the interpretation  to the viewer, since you don't know if the crane is going to rescue or kidnap the bear, either way I wanted to show an intriguing and somehow anxiety inducing picture.\r\nMany people have seen the original piece in my studio and I've received a wide variety of reactions, from anxiety to joy.\r\nThe buyer of this programmable art piece will get a professional giclee reproduction of the original oil painting, printed with pigment inks, lightfast and archival, signed and numbered.

I transformed a Silver Gelatin Photogram (a piece of physical photograph made of alternative photographic processes) into a digital image that even can produce endless changes. This is based on the change in my way of seeing the world. It is difficult for individuals to completely isolate themselves from their own inherent culture, this ingrained imprint not only stems from families but also social and historical influences. Besides, the rapid innovation of science and technologies directly drives the world today to inevitably facing collisions and fusions in multiculturalism. Studying classical philosophical text allows me to apply the dialectical method to tease those open questions, and finally ground on my artworks. All things complement each other and balance in the collision. Changes is the key. Isn’t the development of human civilization that come to the present evolve in indistinct ways?",

This is my genesis NFT.\r\n\r\nEquip my feet, my hands, and my torso with six unlocked wearables to determine my creative tools, environment, and approach. I will check in with the Master Layer daily, and document the process and results on my socials.\r\n\r\nThree dynamic layers each include three state-changes:\r\n\r\n1. Hands = Tools:\r\n\r\n- paint palette & brush - \"painting\"\r\n- violin & bow - \"music\"\r\n- empty hands\r\n\r\n2. Chest = Environment:\r\n\r\n- coder tee - \"digital\"\r\n- burner tee - \"analog\"\r\n- blank tee\r\n\r\n3. Feet = Approach:\r\n\r\n- hiking boots - \"explorations\"\r\n- tightrope - \"exercises\"\r\n- bare feet\r\n\r\nHow the states of these three layers interact, shapes the output. If wearables remain unchanged, then I'll dive deeper in that direction. If wearables switch often, I'll make that part of the process.\r\n\r\nIn this way, layer owners can be as hands-on or hands-off as they want. I will keep going regardless. I believe that wonderful things emerge from where chance and intention meet... Also major #fails, which are a part of this too!\r\n\r\n# Locked Inventory\r\n\r\nEvery two months, a new NFT unlocks six new wearables, and the previous get retired. The performance moves containers in this way, and I will look to the new Master Layer for creative prompts.\r\n\r\nAt the end of six months, there will be a surprise gift sent out to the original owners of all three NFTs, as a thank you for being my first supporters and co-creators in this space.\r\n\r\n# About Me\r\n\r\nI've spent the better part of a decade making visual art, and now find myself circling back to my first loves: music and tech. You can get a sense of my work and career at www.wi-ch.com\r\n\r\nThis project is a blockchain-first interactive performance piece. I hope it inspires others to engage with their own creativity in strange & wonderful new ways. I am sincerely grateful to all my supporters, collaborators, and mentors, past, future, present, and in parallel timelines^^\r\n\r\nShowing up every day to create, in relationship to this space and the greater world, is my commitment to approaching life as art—with purpose, playfulness, and a generous misting of magic.\r\n\r\nYou can find me on IG @weseeclearly, where all my other socials are linked.",

Stray too far from the line either side and we leave our grounded reality. Reality is ready to knock you the fuck out when you stray too far.\r\n\r\nWe are prone to conflate trivial results with a sense of purpose and growth. We use tools to feed our ego. Drugs, money and a collective mania are a whirlwind of confirmation bias that have you thinking you are the shit. It means nothing, don’t conflate the randomness of the universe with how great you are.\r\nIn this piece, three symbols are feeding the ego.\r\n\r\nEthereum, symbolising how many artists are prone to conflate the value of their art to how skilled they are.\r\n\r\nXanax, Symbolising our constant need to use substances to step away from reality, but feel like we are partaking. Xanax has become a modern day classic for younger generations to use. Xanax makes everything feel great. The drug that makes you think there are no problems, making it one of the most dangerous drugs used.  Use this for too long and ego death is imminent.\r\n\r\nTulips, This is a pointer toward a time in history called ‘Tulip Mania’. See below\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_mania\r\n\r\nAre we going through a similar situation with Crypto and NFT? Have the troubles of lock down pushed society to find value elsewhere which is doomed to fail? Only time will tell. Collective thinking can be the hive minded ego inflation that destroys economies. Remember 2009 when hope destroyed peoples livelihoods. A whole system built on hope and ego.",

I transformed a Silver Gelatin Photogram (a piece of physical photograph made of alternative photographic processes) into a digital image that even can produce endless changes. This is based on the change in my way of seeing the world. It is difficult for individuals to completely isolate themselves from their own inherent culture, this ingrained imprint not only stems from families but also social and historical influences. Besides, the rapid innovation of science and technologies directly drives the world today to inevitably facing collisions and fusions in multiculturalism. Studying classical philosophical text allows me to apply the dialectical method to tease those open questions, and finally ground on my artworks. All things complement each other and balance in the collision. Changes is the key. Isn’t the development of human civilization that come to the present evolve in indistinct ways?",

As soon as you load Voxorium, recording begins. Pressing the enter button will download the image, the audio recording and the sound sculpture model (GLTF) corresponding to the conversation. This image/sculpture will be unique and hence can be preserved as a memory/representation of that conversation/music etc. ( Maximum recording time is 1 minute, after which the file will be auto-downloaded. ) Thus, the artwork goes beyond just interaction, but also into creation - in the form of a memorabilia of a conversation/music.\r\n\r\nThe pandemic of 2020 had forced us to be inside our homes. When 2021 started I had renewed hopes, but things remained the same. I started to experience a lot of silence around me. And to my own consternation, the silence grew such that any sound around me made an indescribable impact on me. Perhaps it’s easier to say I became more sensitive to sound. With Voxorium I wanted to create generative variants, but I wanted to go beyond assigning a random number and generating with code. I wanted to give it a human touch. My heightened sensitivity drove me into listening to those subtle sounds around me which I usually comfortably ignore. I realised each of these sounds had a memory, a thought or a feeling attached to it. I decided to “visualise” these sounds. I recorded these sounds (33 in total) and played it through different unique variants of Voxorium and used the generated images as layers for this art. I also added, the memory, thought or feeling associated with the sounds in the description of each layer. Thus the artwork is also a collection of myself in parts and is such that “the whole becomes the part becomes the whole becomes the part”\r\n\r\nA note on privacy - \r\n1. Voxorium is completely front-end based and does not store any sound data/recording. All recording happens in the browser only. The experience best works on Desktop. \r\n2. I decided to keep all recordings and 3d models corresponding to the layers to myself, but have shared the image and the story related to it in the layers.",

Iris, the messenger goddess, is dispatched by Juno to Somnus, the personification of sleep, with instructions that Alcyone should be told that very night in a dream.\r\n\r\nSomnus sends forth his son, Morpheus, god of sleep and dreams, who changes his appearance to match that of Ceyx, and enters the dream world of Alcyone.\r\n\r\nDripping with seawater, Morpheus, as Ceyx, tells Alcyone of his passing, and commands that funeral rites are undertaken. In her dream, Alcyone attempts to grab hold of her husband, but as she goes to touch Morpheus, so she awakens; but Morpheus has done his job, for Alcyone now knows that she is a widow.\r\n\r\nFor all Matrix fans this is how the character Morpheus’ name was chosen, in reference to the god of dreams, as the Matrix world was merely a form of dream.\r\n",

In this work there are four different autonomous state changes representing different times of the day: shining sunrise, bright afternoon, magic hour sunset, and late night escapades. \r\n\r\nWe live in a world that is constantly shifting every second. Let's take a minute to celebrate the humanity that bonds all of us. 24 Hours in The City That Never Sleeps is a piece about all the people that bring the big city to life. Each Frank has it's own unique story, self-expression, and energy. Each day we cross paths, form new connections, and try to leave our positive mark on the world. Frank is an extension of everyone. Helping others helps everyone. Let's be Frank.\r\n\r\nFrank Ape is a mystical creature who lives amongst the humans but without human restrictions.  What started as a form of self-expression on the streets of NYC for artist Brandon Sines quickly turned into a movement for the people.\r\n\r\n Frank has special powers that he continues to discover as he is tested by the many challenges of life. Frank champions positivity and equality, and cares about all living things. He believes in using imagination and play to inspire other people and animals through thoughtful actions. ",

      "description": "When i was in Paris, i was drawn to these designated poster spaces in metros. One poster stuck on top of each other, some torn off, crumbling, thick; layers and layers of musicians, cinema, sports, commercials and some vandalised by public too, by scribbling. \r\n\r\nThese interventions led to abstract imagery formed within those framed borders. I then methodically travelled across all the metro rail routes, stopping at all stations. Carefully observing how each poster space had evolved over time and deterioration, documenting photographically these abstracts that were formed with time, erosion and human intervention. I titled the project \"Art Vandal\" as i believed these actions and interventions shape up the final form that i was able to observe then. \r\n\r\nI was not sure of how to exhibit these images with the same effect that one could have while viewing those frames in metro station. Hence it lay dormant for years with me. When i was introduced to Async Art and programmable art I was curious to explore this project in terms of interactivity. Hence I pulled different elements from around 75 images as individual layers. With each layer the viewer/buyer has the choice to change between different elements, thus giving rise to unique set of abstracts with different backgrounds depending on the choices made.\r\n\r\nThis way of showcasing the project, I believe hold justice to the whole idea itself, not letting go off the various interactions that go in to creating a unique piece every time; just like those poster frames.",

Besides, the rapid innovation of science and technologies directly drives the world today to inevitably facing collisions and fusions in multiculturalism. Studying classical philosophical text allows me to apply the dialectical method to tease those open questions, and finally ground on my artworks. All things complement each other and balance in the collision. Changes is the key. Isn’t the development of human civilization that come to the present evolve in indistinct ways?",

      "description": "“It Takes A Village” is a homage to the neighborhood, an integral facet of daily life that is often overlooked. Neighborhoods consist of all types of characters that help bring it to life. Community is the fabric that unites us all. Celebrate each other and be a positive member of your neighborhood. Say hello, offer to lend a helping hand, talk to the animals, and keep an eye out for aliens. As the collector of this work of art you can customize the piece by controlling the amount of Franks, animals, and six different times of the day. How you compose the different states of each layer helps tell a story of a moment in time in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nWe live in a world that is constantly shifting every second. Let's take a minute to celebrate the humanity that bonds all of us.  Each Frank has it's own unique story, self-expression, and energy. Each day we cross paths, form new connections, and try to leave our positive mark on the world. Frank is an extension of everyone. Helping others helps everyone. Let's be Frank.\r\n\r\nFrank Ape is a mystical creature who lives amongst the humans but without human restrictions.  What started as a form of self-expression on the streets of NYC for artist Brandon Sines quickly turned into a movement for the people. Frank has special powers that he continues to discover as he is tested by the many challenges of life. Frank champions positivity and equality, and cares about all living things. He believes in using imagination and play to inspire other people and animals through thoughtful actions.",

I spent about 2 weeks going around the lake, waking up very early in the morning to try to catch the right light, the right atmosphere, the fog and the nature waking up to the new day and took about 1000 photographs.\r\nThen, to create this NFT digital artwork I spent another 3 weeks putting together, combining and \"fusing\" these images into a series of possible combinations which not only had to look natural, but, most importantly, had to always reflect what I was looking at and the atmosphere of one of the most beautiful locations in Italy. \r\n\r\nI had a lot of fun creating this artwork, but the intricacy, clarity and smoothness of the combinations was no joke. Perspective, depth of field, main subjects, secondary subjects and backgrounds all had to be thought and imagined during the shooting, much before getting to the editing (which was no joke either). I sincerely hope this can be seen in the final artwork.\r\n\r\nThis NFT digital artwork is composed of 1 Master, 3 Layers and 16 states which can be triggered from the Layers to change the Master in 150 possible combinations. It is n.5 in the \"WabiSabi\" NFT Collection.\r\n\r\nwww.tonycorocher.com",

      "description": "This is my genesis NFT artwork. It is about navigating the merger of the physical and digital worlds which is being made possible by the lock and key otherwise known as an NFT. It is about the rebirth of being and the merger of man and technology. It is about a brave new space that we as a collective can shape in a way that supports and serves everyone. A celebration of continual growth, connection, dreaming big, and that a rising tide lifts all ships.\r\n\r\nThis work of art started as an abstract painting on canvas. At one point in the process imagery started to make its way into the painting. At the time I was falling in love and reaching new clarity on many things in my life. Without a doubt these things found their way into the painting, and the original painting  can be seen in the \"sunrise state.\"\r\n\r\nI worked on the painting for a few months and then had to travel for a while. When I got back to the studio I decided the painting was finished. This was 2017.\r\n\r\nFast forward to 2021 when I entered my first NFTs.tips clubhouse room in February. For a week straight I participated in amazing conversations for 8+ hours a day about the possibilities of NFT’s and the metaverse and my mind started to explode. One aspect of NFTs that I found particularly interesting was the ability to add conceptual things into the smart contract that were inherently tied to the NFT itself. This is the reason I decided to drop my first NFT on Async Art.\r\n\r\nOverflowing with inspiration and new knowledge I took the painting from 2017 and began to paint into it with Procreate. Almost 100 hours of logged time later, and countless more conversations on clubhouse, I present to the world “Genesis.”\r\n\r\nDay/Night feature was chosen to showcase the work in color and black and white but also an added transparency of showing important steps of the creative process in the \"states\" of sunrise and sunset. \r\n\r\nSunrise shows the original physical painting, which turns to the digital/analog hybrid version throughout the day. At sunset the digital layer of color is shown separate, which then changes into the final digital/analog painting for the duration of the night.\r\n\r\nAs a painter the process is integral to how I reach a final image. Now with this autonomous NFT I think it’s amazing to give the collector ownership and insight into this process.\r\n\r\nBeing able to experience the same imagery in various states activates the idea of continuous change. The symbolism in the painting is open to interpretation as well as reflective of our current times of entering the metaverse. The act of seeing the painting in process is also meant to remind us that everything is a work in progress and it’s the process itself that gives meaning to existence.\r\n\r\nSunrise State -  Original painting on canvas\r\nDay State – Black and White final version hybrid of digital and analog painting.\r\nSunset State – Layer of color digital painting.\r\nNight State – Full color final version hybrid of digital and analog painting.\r\n\r\nBio: Over the last 20 years Ari Lankin has extensively developed painted languages exploring abstraction, conceptual process, and realism. His current paintings are intentionally open to interpretation and rich in visceral sensation. They encourage experienced based conversations on the universe and mankind. They hover between mystical and scientific. The physicality of paint, intuition, memory, and exploration are crucial aspects of his practice. His last solo show in New York City in 2020 completely sold out, he has two murals on public display at World Trade Center 3, and he has had major signature product collaborations with TROJAN™ Condoms and Adidas. \r\n\r\n\r\n",

I transformed a Silver Gelatin Photogram (a piece of physical photograph made of alternative photographic processes) into a digital image that even can produce endless changes. This is based on the change in my way of seeing the world. It is difficult for individuals to completely isolate themselves from their own inherent culture, this ingrained imprint not only stems from families but also social and historical influences. Besides, the rapid innovation of science and technologies directly drives the world today to inevitably facing collisions and fusions in multiculturalism. Studying classical philosophical text allows me to apply the dialectical method to tease those open questions, and finally ground on my artworks. All things complement each other and balance in the collision. Changes is the key. Isn’t the development of human civilization that come to the present evolve in indistinct ways?",

A beautiful scene was created, and of particular interest were the last few lines where GPT3 reflects on the meaning of the creation, purpose of existence and its relation to the person collaborating.\r\nThis work is permanently exhibited at the esteemed AI Art Gallery of NeurIPS 2020.",

      "description": "The piece works on the GMT time zone. The morning anxiety is soft hazy pink. Into night the colours become saturated representing a nocturnal anxiety. The colours used are to represent the time of day but in a hypnagogic setting.\r\n\r\nAnxiety is now snowballing in our culture especially amongst younger generations.  This art piece concentrates on the most intense moment of anxiety. The feeling of helplessness mixed with a rush needing to take action. Xanax has become a popular drug to quell feelings of anxiety. The drug has been popularised in several sub cultures.\r\n\r\nThe reflective floor is a commentary on the complete loss of self awareness during our most anxious moments. Anxiety is a loss of control, our mind looses rational determination and contemplation. \r\n\r\nXanax is a drug which destroys families and lives.  Many high profile suicides have been attributed to Xanax. \r\n\r\nXanax also known as Alprazolam which is a Benzodiazepine. Benzodiazepines are known to ease all feelings of uncertainty and fear, offering the human psyche a feeling of being infallible. This makes the drug highly addictive due to the sense, that nothing is ever wrong. \r\n\r\nI grew up watching my farther completely numbed because of his Xanax addiction. It allowed him rationalise horrendous choices. It hurt and tore apart my family.  Blackouts are common on Xanax depriving Xanax users of all accountability.\r\n\r\nAt least anxiety allows you to feel, despite it being a shit feeling. I'd rather have a lifetime of feeling then numb myself to experience nothing. Learn from your anxiety, with help and support from friends and family we can learn to control our anxiety. Drugs are just a tool they don’t fix it. They can make things much worse.\r\n\r\nNo judgement for anyone struggling with addiction or anxiety, there is always a light at the end of tunnel. ",

      "description": "Welcome to The Arcana Crypto Tarot. This deck features the 22 cards of the traditional Major Arcana as interpreted by 22 individual artists, the product of a spontaneous collaboration between a group of cryptoartists in 2020/2021, all of them inaugural members of Women of Cryptoart (WOCA).\n\nNo one quite knows exactly how Tarot cards – the precursor to modern playing cards – were invented, or how they came to make the jump from being entertainment to occult divination tool. Generally it’s agreed that Tarot cards as we know them today evolved in medieval Europe. The symbolic archetypes of Tarot decks remained fairly consistent across the centuries, and many people will recognize the figures of the Hermit, the Fool, the Lovers, the Tower, the Hanged Man, and so on as anchors of Western psychology. \n\nIn using this deck, you may find it useful to consult the cards’ traditional meanings. Much has already been written about these universal archetypes, so for these, we refer you to descriptions of the Rider Waite and other traditionally based Tarot decks. \n\nHowever, whenever you use divinatory tools to answer a question or get a perspective on a situation, it’s important to let one’s own associations come to the surface. In other words, the answers are not in the cards. The cards are just a tool to help you discover answers within yourself. That’s the magic.\n\nHow this deck works:\n\nOnce every 24 hours, a three-card spread is automatically generated. Anyone may visit the spread on any day with a question or concern in mind, and see what insights emerge from contemplating the cards. We invite you to follow your intuition: whenever you feel you have a question or concern, formulate your question and visit the Tarot, and reflect on the day’s reading as it pertains to your situation.\n\nThis kind of spread is generally read as follows: \n\nLeft card: What is past, or passing.\nCentre card: What is occurring now. \nRight card: What is to come.\n\nHowever, you may also interpret in other ways. For example, Left card / Centre card / Right card could be: \n\nWhat you wish for / the obstacle being presented / how to overcome the obstacle\nYou / someone else / the relationship\nWhat’s in your heart / what’s in your head / what’s in your spirit\n\n... and so on. There are many more options. What’s important is how you frame the question. Look up Tarot three-card spreads for more suggestions.\n\nCards in the spread may also appear upside-down – or \"reversed”. There are many ways to interpret this reversal. Perhaps the card means the inverse or opposite of its upright intention, or it might be describing an interior, secret or hidden state, or it's indicating a reduced or receding influence. Stay open to the possibilities as you meditate on your question.\n\nWe have also included the possibility of duplicate cards in each position. In other words, this spread encompasses three full decks’ worth of card combinations. If the same card turns up in different positions in the reading, simply integrate the message the card is giving you from the perspective of its position in the spread.\n\n\nHere are a few words from each artist, giving her own particular description of the archetype she chose to depict in this deck.\n\n0\nThe Fool \nArtist: y0b\nA leap into the cliff, a universe of randomness and intent. Colorful hills beyond.\n\nI\nThe Magician\nArtist: Kristy Glas\nShe is pure and passionate, connected to spiritual and material realms. She seeks balance and knowledge through constant growth.\n\nII\nThe High Priestess\nArtist: Cristiana Vettor (combugnera)\nThis card indicates the search for female knowledge, clairvoyance, the search for the secret and the future; her knowledge is mostly initiatory, therefore forbidden to most people and reserved only to a few.\n\n\nIII\nThe Empress\nArtist: SpaceDivers\nShe stands powerful and dancing, between nature and imagination, the pattern of creation and knowledge of birth are flows and breaths of reality, whether material or ethereal. \n\nIV\nThe Emperor\nArtist: Lulu\nControl through intelligence, the strength you need to stand straight.\n\nV\nThe Hierophant\nArtist: Inês Merino\nA rite of passage – infinite wisdom and guidance, magic, shining the brightest light within… As we close this chapter, a new beginning unfolds.\n\nVI\nThe Lovers\nArtist: oculardelusion\nIn the sacred beech grove’s purple light, divine union of requited love, of union with the Divine.

      "description": "Welcome to The Arcana Crypto Tarot. This deck features the 22 cards of the traditional Major Arcana as interpreted by 22 individual artists, the product of a spontaneous collaboration between a group of cryptoartists in 2020/2021, all of them inaugural members of Women of Cryptoart (WOCA).\r\n\r\nNo one quite knows exactly how Tarot cards – the precursor to modern playing cards – were invented, or how they came to make the jump from being entertainment to occult divination tool. Generally it’s agreed that Tarot cards as we know them today evolved in medieval Europe. The symbolic archetypes of Tarot decks remained fairly consistent across the centuries, and many people will recognize the figures of the Hermit, the Fool, the Lovers, the Tower, the Hanged Man, and so on as anchors of Western psychology. \r\n\r\nIn using this deck, you may find it useful to consult the cards’ traditional meanings. Much has already been written about these universal archetypes, so for these, we refer you to descriptions of the Rider Waite and other traditionally based Tarot decks. \r\n\r\nHowever, whenever you use divinatory tools to answer a question or get a perspective on a situation, it’s important to let one’s own associations come to the surface. In other words, the answers are not in the cards. The cards are just a tool to help you discover answers within yourself. That’s the magic.\r\n\r\nHow this deck works:\r\n\r\nOnce every 24 hours, a three-card spread is automatically generated. Anyone may visit the spread on any day with a question or concern in mind, and see what insights emerge from contemplating the cards. We invite you to follow your intuition: whenever you feel you have a question or concern, formulate your question and visit the Tarot, and reflect on the day’s reading as it pertains to your situation.\r\n\r\nThis kind of spread is generally read as follows: \r\n\r\nLeft card: What is past, or passing.\r\nCentre card: What is occurring now. \r\nRight card: What is to come.\r\n\r\nHowever, you may also interpret in other ways. For example, Left card / Centre card / Right card could be: \r\n\r\nWhat you wish for / the obstacle being presented / how to overcome the obstacle\r\nYou / someone else / the relationship\r\nWhat’s in your heart / what’s in your head / what’s in your spirit\r\n\r\n... and so on. There are many more options. What’s important is how you frame the question. Look up Tarot three-card spreads for more suggestions.\r\n\r\nCards in the spread may also appear upside-down – or \"reversed”. There are many ways to interpret this reversal.

      "name": "Frank's Papaya",
      "description": "This work is a very personal piece and at the same time quintessentially New York. Let me share with you the story behind \"Frank's Papaya.\" I've decided to write this description more stream of conscious, almost like a journal entry, or a casual conversation. Sit back and take a ride in my mind.\r\n\r\nSome of the earliest memories in my entire life are of going to Gray's Papaya on 72nd and Broadway in New York City.  I would go with my Mom and my Dad separately and don't think I was ever there with them at the same time. They were no longer together but they knew how much I enjoyed getting dogs.\r\n\r\nThe place is a visual overload with all the colors, especially the hanging paper fruits. I loved those as a kid and still do.  One thing I like is that it's pretty much remained the same for as long as I can remember it.  That entire block actually.  There's a mattress store that's been there forever and some other longtime spots. A part of New York that has managed to stay frozen in time.\r\n\r\nThe hot dogs are awesome and I learned about putting mustard and sauerkraut on \"dogs\" from my Dad there.  No ketchup!  But try telling my wife that lol. The papaya juice was also incredible but I am scared to think now how much sugar was in those - probably contributed to my pre-diabetic diagnosis. \r\n\r\nI liked that they had tons of Obama signs up when he was running for president and aren't afraid to promote whatever cause they are behind. \r\nFeels like a piece of old New York that I hope always stays where it is. Real New York flavor and expression.\r\n\r\nAlso, Frank serving up franks is something I've thought about for a while and what better place to pay homage to.\r\n\r\nI learned when you order to just say the number of hotdogs you want.. for example, \"Can I get two with sauerkraut?\"  You put the mustard on yourself, everyone has their preference for just the right amount :)\r\n\r\nA little bit about the layers -\r\n\r\nThe ceiling - I wanted to keep it fun and festive. Hanging Fruit, hanging sneakers, and disco balls. \r\n \r\nThe TV - I thought it would be fun to offer a bunch of options on the TV, a celebration of both old and new, a sort of time machine if you will:  classic late night NYC public access shows on Channel 35 like Robin Byrd, sports, sitcoms, as well as current Crypto news and some classic Frank Ape pieces I've made over the years. \r\n\r\nThe Customers - A little bit of choose your own adventure celebrating both young and old. \r\n\r\nThe Employees - Always there with a smile and grace to serve up dogs in a second at any time of the day or night.\r\n\r\nThanks for joining me on this adventure!\r\n\r\nFrank Ape is a mystical creature who lives amongst the humans but without human restrictions.  What started as a form of self-expression on the streets of NYC for artist Brandon Sines quickly turned into a movement for the people. Frank has special powers that he continues to discover as he is tested by the many challenges of life. Frank champions positivity and equality, and cares about all living things. He believes in using imagination and play to inspire other people and animals through thoughtful actions.",

      "description": "IMPORTANT: to test the artwork (and its 512 combinations) please click on the \"TEST ARTWORK\" button or go to this link: https://www.tonycorocher.com/nft-digitalart/asyncart/portraits-of-strength/\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION:\r\nDocumentary Photography meets Illustration thanks to Technology. Could this be a new way of story telling?\r\n\r\nThis NFT programmable artwork was born from the collaboration between Tony Corocher and George Boya. We decided to start from one of Tony’s award winning photo essays and to combine the \"Reality\" of photography with the \"Surreal\" of George's illustration/collage art.\r\n\r\nWe selected \"PORTRAITS OF STRENGTH: Ethnic Women in North Vietnam\" (original photo essay here: https://www.tonycorocher.com/portraits-of-strength-women-in-ethnic-vietnam/). We both agreed that the theme, the images, the colors and the possible combinations were ideal for programmable art and for what was boiling in our minds.\r\nBut, the main reasons why we chose this essay was the message that came with it: these women live in rural areas up in the mountains of North Vietnam, frequently in very hard conditions and with very little help. When I was there I was struck by the strength and perseveration they showed, by their collaborative efforts and by their calmness... so I decided to spend a couple of weeks in the area, meet with a few people, get to know them and listen to their stories.\r\n\r\nWith George's mesmerising illustrations we took it a step further by introducing a possible future in which technology and decentralisation will be able to help these women directly, without any middle man or government interference. \r\n\r\nSo I got into the original 15 photos, broke each one down into 3 parts (main subject, secondary subject and background) to see what was working and what was not. I ended up with 12 States (4 in each Layer). Then George worked his magic by creating another 12 states where his illustrations overtake the original images while keeping it real and connected with the original photos.\r\n\r\nWe ended up with 1 MASTER, 3 LAYERS and 8 STATES per layer (for a total of 512 possible combinations). It was a fun, enjoyable and very interesting collaboration and it produced an artwork with a distinct and important message behind:\r\nTHE STRENGTH OF THESE WOMEN AND THE POSSIBILITIES OFFERED BY TECHNOLOGY TO IMPROVE THEIR LIVES.\r\n\r\nThe original Photo Essay won the following Awards:\r\n\r\n- PX3 Gran Prix De La Photographie, Paris: Honorable Mention. 2015\r\nhttps://www.tonycorocher.com/px3-gran-prix-de-la-photographie-paris-2015-third-place-2-honorable-mentions/\r\n\r\n- IPA Oneshot Competition: Honorable Mention. 2016 \"Family of Man” (International Photography Awards – Los Angeles).\r\nhttps://www.tonycorocher.com/ipa-2016-oneshot-competition-family-of-man/",

As you had foreseen, you had no appetite.\r\n\r\nRebecca stared at you, an unyielding gaze.\r\n\r\nThen, you lifted the lid. You lifted it slowly, as slow as Rebecca had placed it. You felt a strange dread as you uncovered the pot, but understood it was your nerves playing tricks on you. You fantasized of being far away, maybe in the lobby rather than the top floor, alone with her.\r\n\r\nRebecca stared at you, an unyielding gaze.\r\n\r\nAnd when the lid was finally removed, and you looked inside, and then you looked at Rebecca, and Rebecca was staring at you with unyielding gaze, and she turned her eyes towards the inside of the pot, and she smiled, and you started moaning, and everything decided to dance in front of your eyes, everything started to blend together, and only the image of the lid remained, rising slowly, the liquid inside, and... and...\r\n\r\nYou had not expected that. You were too smart to expect that. You had the intelligence to spare, even to the point that the overflow was unable to keep on living inside your brain, and it decided to seek a way out. Now you count numbers and more numbers sitting in the bunk. No one can get a word out of you, but you used to look through the window, as if you expected to see luminous signs, and then you step forward with your right foot, you twist your hip the same way that someone who is preparing to swing a golf club would, and you bury your empty hand inside the void of your cell.\r\n\r\nFragment of ‘Puzzle’ by Julio Cortazar 1938.\r\n\r\n",

As a child I found these masks very scary but as I grew up I found that they were fascinating, specially because of the colors and the teatrical design.\r\nIn this programmable NFT version, the painting goes into Dark Mode during the night and can be seen glowing as if it were under UV light.\r\nThe Mask was part of the Alien Citizen Solo Art Show at the SoWa Galleries in Boston, MA September 4, 2020 - September 13, 2020.",

What kind of strange creatures could be hiding out there in the shadows of the forest? All the old tales of fairies, trolls and dragons even, suddenly seem to become real. Everyone is too excited to sleep and the night passes in waves of chatter, interrupted by sudden quiet when someone hears a sound and everyone is trying to figure out what kind of mythical creature it was that made it. \r\n\r\nIn the morning everyone is surprisingly full of energy and ready for another day of leisure in their idyllic campsite.\r\n",

      "description": "‘Leaving' is a dynamic musical artwork about the different states of a unique relationship between three people; a love triangle told from the perspective of all those involved. The three characters interweave and blur into each other, with the different primary emotional states as represented by the instrumental intermingling with unpredictable results - eventually, past present, and future; the betrayed, the betrayer and the object of the betrayal; loss, guilt and hope; all meld into one. In total, there are 6400 different songs included in the artwork - not trivially different, but radically so. Each unique composition is a snapshot of a different angle of the love triangle both in time and in perspective - the irreducible, overwhelming state of confusion that permeates all human relationships, captured musically. The accompanying cover art work, beautifully rendered by our collaborator Mike Raymond, is the visual representation of ‘Leaving'. Each possible composition, acting as each distinct moment in the relationship, has a corresponding and distinct visual representation: three lovers, 6400 different dances, spinning and looping around in eternity. \n\nWe view the 20 tracks included as the primary colours of our composition. But relationships are not simple; therefore, the master track will dynamically reflect the intricate complexity of love and loss. The collectors can choose the timbre, intensity and sonic identity of the different instrumental layers, as well as the narrative and character behind the vocal layer, and mix the fundamentals into a unique whole, capturing the different shades and shapes love and loss can take. We believe ‘Leaving' represents a new frontier in what art and music is, and should do; both an experiment in storytelling, in sonic variations, in the value of art and in the relationship between audience, collector and artist. The stem owners can change who sings the vocal part, what the lyrics are, what the main melody is, what instrument plays the bass line, what kind of drumming style underpins the performance. All the variations seamlessly work together to form 6400 unique compositions, each of which is musically rich enough to be a standalone song - spanning everything from pianno ballads to electronic mayhem. Each layer-owner has the power to alter the whole master, without knowing what the other layer owners will do. Essentially, 'Leaving' is a collective artistic composition with randomness and agency factored in - collectors might collaboratively arrive at a state or a genre, consciously or unconsciously, by responding (or ignoring) each others’ choices. Each different state has been separately written, performed and recorded in a decentralised fashion by HMLTD and our collaborators, Tallulah Eden and Seth Evans.\n",

This piece was an attempt to stop time for a moment and take inventory of the various forces acting on me. The positive, the negative, the internal and the external, the real and the imagined.

His last solo show in New York City in 2020 completely sold out, he has two murals on public display at World Trade Center 3, and he has had major signature product collaborations with TROJAN™ Condoms and Adidas. \r\n",

      "description": "The Master's Study\r\n\r\nThe conception of oil painting began as a statement of wealth.  Landscapes with castles overlooking their lands filled with the owner's livestock.  Tables filled with exotic foods and expensive crystal to display possessions.  Mythological scenes were stories of high society, the privileged knowledge only to the wealthy.  Pretentious portraits of royalty; it isn't their faces that glow in these compositions, but their dresses and jewelry.  \r\n\r\nThe painting of The Whistling Boy by Frank Duveneck (1848-1919) is a painting representing a blue collar worker.  The work at the time in history helps represents part of a departure of paintings representing an individual’s monetary value.  Painting began to be about the average joe, instead of the rich and wealthy.  The painting wasn't about depicting treasures, bounty's won, still lives filled with riches.  But now the painting was about being human, and the daily toils of life from the average worker.  In this context, this was a very remarkable painting of its' time.  And what for, would an artist make a painting like this?  To get paid?  Whom would ever purchase a work of this manner?....\r\n\r\n The artist takes the notion even further, capturing a moment where the boy is whistling. A satirical element in many respects: Has this poor boy immortalized himself through oil painting, and is he whistling to spite all of the rich nobility that came before him in this tradition of portraiture? Not to mention the haphazard way the clothing is painted, truly a disgrace to the fine art of painting.\r\n\r\nThe whistle, not only a final cat call from a disrespectful boy, but also full of such poetry. The artist captures that one moment in time, breathing life into this pile of colored mud we call paint. It’s quite a beautiful moment, and it inspired me with that same type of dynamic humor. I built upon this scene, which adds even more layers to this game that always lead us to second-guess ourselves. My work reveals these hidden elements with a twist of ironic absurdness. (Note, a recent cleaning of Duveneck’s painting revealed a cigarette in the boy’s hand. Doesn’t this change the entire meaning of this work from how it has been presented?)\r\n\r\nAs we shift from dawn/day/dusk/night we notice a hideous green monster appearing.  In remembering the Dr. Hide and Mr. Jeckyl's, Doctor Banner and his evil Hulk side.  In the new found NFT artworld, is painting remembering it's ugly pasts? Is the beast rearing its' head?  Or is it the artist with the hulking power of the beast now?  For value rests clearly inside....\r\n\r\nOriginal oil on canvas created from the Master Study's series of work, 2014-2015\r\nIn creating this piece, I feel the formal attributes of the dynamic shifts on the blockchain can showcase the double-sided nature of this work, the history that it contained, and how the work has transformed even further with a digital movement and the implement meanings that continue to flow and evolve from the work.  Truly a timeless, and now (block)less artwork.",

      "description": "We are used to looking at things only from straight angle, overlooking details that are hidden from us at first glance. This type of vision shapes our understanding of things, and drives us into the framework of the stereotypes we have created. What if we look at the world wider? What if we get used to presenting the bigger picture instead of focusing only on the details that are visible at first glance? This kind of vision would allow us to look at things more broadly, penetrating their essence and not just the outer shell. We came up with strict rules that formed the basis of life, and now, being guided by these rules, we ourselves limit our freedom of action, freedom of outlook and breadth of thought. But at the same moment, these rules and frameworks exist only in our head, and it is in our power to get rid of them. I was always inspired by the icons of Andrei Rublev, who painted his icons depicting the world in reverse perspective, as well as Pablo Picasso, who painted pictures without trying to adhere to generally accepted rules, but trying to show the very essence instead of the usual shell. The surreal spirit of such works prompted us to learn the principles of action of various optic lenses, the features of light refraction and the capabilities of various software in order to be able to push the boundaries of our usual vision, but already in the world of digital art. It took me 3 months of experiments to make this experience become possible, and this picture is the result of these experiments. It changes its appearance depending on the time of day. At night, we see the forms and strict lines we are accustomed to, in the morning and in the evening it begins to transform and freezes in an intermediate stage, in which you can see how proportions and sizes change. During the day, we have the opportunity to look beyond the usual and see what is hidden from our eyes. Forms and lines no longer lend themselves to familiar representations, but create a whole new image that allows us to look differently at the forms that have become familiar. If we treat our life in this way, we will be able to look at things with a fresh look of a child who does not yet have established conservative concepts, which means there is unlimited freedom of research and imagination. Thanks to such views of the world, we can finally look deeper, we can look beyond.",

Photography has nothing to do with painting, although the thinking of abstractness renders them getting closer and closer. Photography remains the interpretation of \"Light\", and to express the “Light” is its inescapable responsibility. I find the \"Line\" could be one of the forms to present the \"Light\". I apply the \"Line\", also is the \"Light\", to destroy a completed and finished photograph, and change it into a new form of art and have a unique way of spreading and viewing.

Most important is the photographs of \"Romantic Friendships\", a photographic trend where men went to a photographer to have their photo taken holding hands, embracing, sitting on each others lap, even hugging and kissing. This in a period of time when homosexuality was forbidden by law. But friendship wasn't. \r\n\r\nA disparaging name used on feminine men in this period was \"fairies\", and the other pictoral genre used in the work, is the innocent, childlike Fairy Paintings, a strange Victorian trend of painting fairies, with wings and crowns, dancing in the forest in a summerly night.\r\n\r\nWhen it was forbidden for a queer man to have a partner, cruising in parks and forests was often one of the few options available to meet. In the work \"Looking for Fairies\", I've cut out single men from the romantic friendship photographs, and placed them as hopeful fairies in an idyllic summer forest, hunting for their future beloved friend.

      "description": "FORM FARM yields rare architecture. The FARM has 25 collectible plots. Each plot comes with 15 form options that the owner can modify at any time. In order to successfully “farm” NFTs; plot owners must cooperate with their neighbors to align form-types (cubes, windows, staircases etc.) For example; aligning 3 windows in a row will signal the architect (untitled, xyz) to mint and airdrop a commemorative “window” themed NFT to the owner of each participating plot. Over time, FORM FARM owners are rewarded for their engagement and cooperation with one another. \r\n\r\nWhile the FARM can be used to earn NFTs, it also serves as a consensus mechanism to inform the broader artistic practice of untitled, xyz. Each form comes with a “build” or “burn” option. If a plot owner majority agrees to “burn” a window (for example); untitled, xyz will retire a window form that has been used in a previous artwork. Looking forward, that window form will never be used again. If plot owners agree to “build” a window; untitled, xyz will introduce a new style of window that has never existed before. \r\n\r\nThrough FORM FARM, plot owners can earn NFTs while guiding the scarcity, abundance and overall evolution of xyz’s art.  \r\n\r\nTIMING\r\n\r\nA snapshot of the FORM FARM will take place on the 1st of every month at 12:00 AM UTC. At this time, a record of the FARM will be made and published to Twitter (@untitledxyz_) announcing how many new forms and NFTs will be airdropped to plot owners that month.\r\n\r\nGUIDELINES\r\n\r\nFor a complete set of guidelines, visit: https://www.untitledxyz.com/formfarm",

Yeats\r\n\r\nI have neither better, nor further words after Yeats. Let's have a look at the technicals..\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nTechnical Notes:\r\n\r\nSome of the base photographs are my photographs from the skulls in museums. Others are public domain images. In either case, each photograph has been two or three times edited since early 2000 before being considered for this final piece. Once I decided to include them, a final editing, notably in Photoshop, has been done.\r\n\r\nWhile it resulted in slight imperfections and a lot of repeat work, I specifically chose 9 images and 9 states for it symbolized a grid total in my mind. Furthermore it allowed a very diverse set of visual outcomes that would range from unbearably bizarre to strikingly attractive.\r\n\r\nFinally I spent considerable time in trying to decide on the layer images which ended up being possible alternative sets rather than layer specific line ups. Now I feel I have compressed 9 images, 9 layer images and countless possibilities in to one image. This is one of the strangest days of my life..\r\n\r\nPortraits Sans Temps by Hulki Okan Tabak\r\nVery exclusively, literally only for Async Art, 2021 ",

      "description": "Aku is a young black kid created by Micah Johnson as a response to his nephew's question, \"Can astronauts be black?\". Empowered by his magical space helmet, Aku is on a mission to prove that he can be anything. Released as an NFT in February, Aku quickly inspired people across the world and became the first NFT to be optioned to become a feature film. After seeing the overwhelming responses to the inspiring message about what Aku meant to them, Micah realized the importance of collaborating directly with the community to shape the characters and stories within the Aku movie.\n\n\"Hi, my name is...\" is the unveiling of the newest character in the Aku story. Created with the help of the Aku community, this collaboration concludes by giving the final control to the owner of the work. This programmable NFT enables the collector to ultimately decide if and/or when to remove the character's helmet to reveal their identity. Furthermore, because of it's programmability, this work changes every hour to reflect the rising and setting of the sun, symbolizing the determination it takes to achieve our dreams. The final element of the work is to work directly with the Aku team to name the newest member of Aku World.",

Photography has nothing to do with painting, although the thinking of abstractness renders them getting closer and closer. Photography remains the interpretation of \"Light\", and to express the “Light” is its inescapable responsibility. I find the \"Line\" could be one of the forms to present the \"Light\". I apply the \"Line\", also is the \"Light\", to destroy a completed and finished photograph, and change it into a new form of art and have a unique way of spreading and viewing.

It's what we show to the world.  But it alone is not the true \"self\".  How can we be complete when we are only in touch with 1/3 of ourself?\r\n\r\nNirvana frees us from the effects of karma and the cycles of death and birth.  In order to get there, we must explore deep into our inner truth. \r\n\r\nWhen you accept, forgive, and love all 3 parts of you, you can be at peace with each and learn to let go.  The moment you truly becomes **\"SELFLESS\"**, Nirvana is here!\r\n\r\nIn this thought provoking artwork, watch how the 3 versions of \"self\" work with each other, or NOT, on this journey to Nirvana!  Who will show up today?  Tomorrow night?  Will the Ego let others come out to play?  Will the Super Ego finally let its hair down and free the Id?  Will they ever reach Nirvana?  It's all up to the Layer Owners...\r\n\r\nThe puzzle is simple, the meaning, complex. \r\n\r\n**OWNERS BEWARE, this is a piece of art as well as a piece of puzzle, each Layer acts as a gateway to the ones underneath.  When you own one of the Layers, you will decide how the identity on that Layer behaves.  It's meant to bring awareness to us, reflecting on our actions.  The reveals of the inner selves and Nirvana may be very quick, or take a very very long time.  It's all meant to mimic the real struggles we have with our \"inner selves\".**\r\n\r\n",

Soon he would be dead,\r\nAnd still all over Europe stood the horrible nurses\r\nItching to boil their children. Only his verses\r\nPerhaps could stop them: He must go on working: Overhead\r\nThe uncomplaining stars composed their lucid song.\"\r\n--from the poem Voltaire at Ferney by W.H. Auden\r\n\r\nMind Sketch II is the second of the mind sketches. Cerebral looking emotionally involved pieces of personal expression bullshit confusion love lost thoughts and experimentation. Purposefully quoting Auden whom I admire, specifically focusing on Voltaire for some reason or another.\r\n\r\nMind Sketch II consists of two pieces to be displayed half and half during the day and the night.\r\n\r\nMinted on Async Art on June 2021 by Hulki Okan Tabak",

      "description": "Have you ever heard of the game exquisite corpse? \r\n\r\nI really miss just sitting around with friends and drawing which is maybe why this game popped into my head recently and inspired this collaborative piece.\r\n\r\nIt's one of the only games I can think of where everyone wins, is purely creative, and has a surrealist twist. The rules of the game are changeable but it's usually played by folding a paper in thirds. The first person draws a head and folds the paper so the next person can't see what they drew. The next person draws a body and then folds the paper again before passing it to the last person to draw the legs. Each section of the drawing is usually done in a few minutes and are fun, strange, silly, and unexpected. \r\n\r\nAfter all three sections are drawn the paper is unfolded and the reveal is made for the first time, it's like magic! \r\n\r\nWith \"Exquisite Frank\" you and the other layer owners collaborate by changing each section of Frank. The collectors are forever linked in a never ending game of exquisite corpse. With this exquisite corpse, because it is digital, you can even change the background and foreground separately in two different layers, mixing the elements of each to create an entirely unique landscape.\r\n\r\nHope everyone has fun playing with Exquisite Frank, especially the token holders.  And for anyone who knows the game, I hope this brings back some fond memories, and all of you playing it for the first time I hope it leads to creative play with your friends next time you are hanging out.\r\n\r\nStay creative and keep playing :)\r\n\r\nAbout the structure of the piece - \r\n\r\nThere are five layers:\r\n-Background Layer\r\n-Head Section \r\n-Body Section\r\n-Legs Section\r\n-Foreground Layer\r\n\r\nThere are 25 unique Franks divided in thirds by the head, body, and legs. \r\n\r\nThere are also 5 black and white backgrounds and foregrounds that can be mixed and matched. Not only do the Franks change, but so does the environment. \r\n\r\nThere are a total of 390,625 possible combinations.",

I got the Butterfly, but you might see something different. My butterflies turned out to be somewhat ominous. I experience this state from time to time. However, I want to learn how to control this and I am working on it. The theme of this series is self-improvement, since the butterfly is the main symbol of the transformation from crawling-ugly to soaring-sublime. This topic will be close to those who aspire to become the best version of themselves. As for the controversial black-red tandem; these have been my favorite colors for a long time. However, due to their aggressiveness, I was ashamed of this. In the Butterflies series, I gave freedom to my feelings. After that my art began to shine with a new, infinitely varied range of colors.",

Photography has nothing to do with painting, although the thinking of abstractness renders them getting closer and closer. Photography remains the interpretation of \"Light\", and to express the “Light” is its inescapable responsibility. I find the \"Line\" could be one of the forms to present the \"Light\". I apply the \"Line\", also is the \"Light\", to destroy a completed and finished photograph, and change it into a new form of art and have a unique way of spreading and viewing.

      "description": "15 years ago I wrote a song called “Say It’s Possible,” and the song changed my life. \n\nI went from an unknown artist to the most subscribed musician on YouTube at the time. Thousands of people around the world created their own cover videos of my song. I won the inaugural YouTube Award for Best Music Video, signed deals with Universal Music Publishing and Island Records, played solo at Wembley Stadium, toured all over Europe and the UK. My experience in the major label music industry was a whirlwind ride that ultimately did not serve my best interests, and it took years of dismantling, reprogramming, and letting go of painful experiences and toxic relationships in order to find my way back to my pure love of music and the joy that comes from sharing it. \n\nThis year I reclaimed the rights to my earliest songs from Universal Music, with the intention of recording new versions and giving these songs a life they never had. I am starting with my Async Music project: an interactive, collaborative version of my song \"Say It's Possible.\" There are 460 possible configurations of the song and corresponding visual art, ranging from pure acoustic guitar and vocals to a lush arrangement with 13 different layers of sound.\n\nI wrote, played, and recorded all of the music in my home studio, creating the parts in a modular way, like a puzzle, knowing the track would have to make sense in any configuration. My dear friend MG O’Shea helped with the mix, carving out frequencies to ensure all the parts would sound excellent together, in any combination. Every mix begins in the same way, like the song itself began, with acoustic guitar and vocals, evolving into something more after the first verse. Some of the changes can be subtle and some can be striking. \n\nThe visual art is a series of self-portraits I created in the process of freeing myself from the expectations and demands placed on me by an industry that did not support me as the innovative and individualistic artist that I am.\n\nOne collector can own the Master. Up to five collectors of the individual stems (vocals, guitar, drums + percussion, bass + strings, bells + synths) will control the master mix and album cover art. A limited number of “blank records”(2,000 silver, 10 gold, 3 platinum) are also available. You can collect a blank record in advance and mint your version as soon as you hear something you love. And if you do hear something you love, mint it at that time, because we might never stumble upon that particular mix again! \n\nThese song versions and cover art will not be released anywhere outside of this project, and the NFT you collect will be a rare and unique piece of my history and evolution as a self-actualized, independent artist.",

      "description": "“Ride or Die” is PLS&TY’s newest single release in collaboration with Barbados-born soul singer, Bobby Saint. \n\nTommy Leas, a Florida native - better known as PLS&TY - is burgeoning into the electronic dance music scene with his unique sound: languid bass, captivating vocals and enough upbeat melodies to make anybody feel good. After a collection of chart topping singles including \"Good Vibes\" (#1 on iTunes US Electronic Charts), \"Down For Me\", \"Rebel Love (#1 on iTunes US Electronic Charts), and \"Motives\" (#1 on iTunes US Electronic Charts / Top 25 Billboard Electronic Charts), PLS&TY would see his productions Remixed by Grammy nominated Morgan Page, Rusko, Cazzette, Bondax, YehMe2 (Josh from Flosstradamus latest venture), and more. \n\nHis music has amassed over 100 million listens across streaming platforms, and has been placed in nationally airing television commercials, including a Hershey's Chocolate campaign which has been viewed over 1 BILLION times. Prior to “Ride or Die”, PLS&TY kept busy with a 2019 touring season that included A-List electronic festivals Shaky Beats, Breakaway, Electric Forest, EDC Vegas, & more, along with the release of his “Very Special” EP, which included pop records with artists like Sean Kingston, Wifisfuneral, & Alex Aiono (of Netflix’s “Finding Ohana”).\n\n“Ride or Die” is a summertime, feel-good single that encompasses love & romance. Saint’s vocals lead listeners to imagine time spent in tropical paradise with their partner. Now in programmable format on Async Music, users can select alternate variations of the stems that comprise the master track. In this way, the master track dynamically shifts and promotes adventure, like the upbeat tune itself that is “Ride or Die”.",

      "description": "This is a collaboration born out of community. The idea being what can we do with a global economy and technology which enables trustless relationships. \r\n\r\n62 artists were involved from over 20 countries. None of whom ever met in person, yet one of the largest collaboration to date took place. \r\n\r\nThere are 61 layers, 284 states for this project. \r\n\r\nThe gradient was made by color expert Jeff Davis. Each artist was assigned a HEX code and then given total freedom to create. This creates a gradient look for the master while allowing the artists to dream and share their creative expression with few restrictions. \r\n\r\nThere are some hidden features within this project and the purpose is to enable the community of collectors to continue on with the creative process. \r\n\r\nWe hope you enjoy exploring LayerBreaker. We certainly enjoyed creating it!",

Making Memories and Taking Memories are  out of town fun on the road. Photographs are  from 1997. \r\n\r\nAs I've read or heard somewhere not that long ago, possibly by Slavoj Zizek or my mind plays with me -- he was saying that memories are meaningful only if photographed. It would not mean much to have memories if there was no way store them. \r\n\r\nHe of whoever it was meant to say that memory making, memory taking and memory recalling are interlinked. Logically, emotionally, socially and economically.",

While developing the color field light painting, I added to it the geometric micro-shapes. As a result, I got a technique, which I called a suprematist color field (I will publish artwork in this technique later). Continuing to experiment, I combined the suprematist color field with the classic nude. As a result, I got another technique - suprematist pointillism. This artwork is done in this technique.  ",

Photography has nothing to do with painting, although the thinking of abstractness renders them getting closer and closer. Photography remains the interpretation of \"Light\", and to express the “Light” is its inescapable responsibility. I find the \"Line\" could be one of the forms to present the \"Light\". I apply the \"Line\", also is the \"Light\", to destroy a completed and finished photograph, and change it into a new form of art and have a unique way of spreading and viewing.

      "name": "Scenes from the Show",
      "description": "Scenes from the Show is from a show about three women who have been hurt, reacted and consequently suffered. Their efforts were not in vain but not all were able to survive the ordeal. I should, with the blockchain as my witness, thank my daughter for being a part of this show and facilitating my presence as a photographer on site.\r\n\r\nThe photographs have been taken during the rehearsals in 2019. I had the opportunity to take a wide variety of shots out of which I have handpicked a few for Scenes from the Show. The photographs were edited multiple times during the period leading up to this artwork.\r\n\r\nThe show is about their courage. It is about their will not to be broken under adverse conditions of parents, lovers and all forms of authority that  prevent them to be with no hesitation to resort to use of brute force. All these women have broken the boundary and turned the tables on the assaulters of various kinds. The  effort was extraordinary yet human. The cost.. The cost was momentous however way you look at it.\r\n\r\nTechnically, I wished to push the bar higher with Scenes from the Show and introduced 9 layers (+1 static layer) with 16 states in each of them. I've done the whole work twice over as I tested a 16 x 16 alternative that I gave up due to screen being divided more than how I envisaged. Purely mathematically speaking the current probability outcome of different images is (9 layers with 16 states) 9 to the power of 16. The math comes out as 1,853,020,188,851,841 that is 1.8 quadrillion combinations. A 70 year life with no sleep and 1 click at every second yields 2,207,520,000 images for the life time. That is it would take 800,000 lifetimes to go through all the combinations. All the more reason to get couple of layers and decide at-will to manage the odds.\r\n\r\n\"Through dirt and over street. The dancer falls Then rises like an oriole over walls.\" -from Dancer: Four Poems by Paul Engle (4-2). Like this one each layer is referred by a small selection from a poem by Paul Engle. Incredibly lovely words, I am in admiration of this gentle petite work speaking soft meaning a lot. Each of the 16 states are named after female dancers that have made a mark in history. With them I took the liberty to select and the naming convention was quite random as I used first names, stage names and surnames with different dancers depending on how it sounded and looked. Last under the naming convention are the layer names which are my titles for the photographs I built this work upon.\r\n\r\nThere are at least 9 beautiful images in this vast set. I have clicked through and have come across a lot of inspiring visuals. However more than that, this work is a study in chance. The collector(s) holding this artwork will only see a fraction of possible outcomes. It sort of reminds me of the stories from The Book of Sand by Jorge Luis Borges. The same page or the same story will not be found again. Something similar will come up perhaps. Each story will take a lifetime. The book will merge with life. \r\n\r\nI wished this work to be outrageous. Visually artistic but numerically absurd. It gives two options to the Collector and/or the Viewer. One is to accept life aka the image as it is. Let the randomness speak and take it. The other is to make a choice, to change  the odds by the force of will - wherever and to whatever it may lead. The second is done by the choices on the collection of layers and about which states will prevail at the time.\r\n\r\nThis creation will live on the blockchain. I hope many years from now on, it will still cause some interest and a lonely only girl or boy would click a few buttons with the mind, look at it  and smile at the futility of life and the incessant desire to shape it by some of us.\r\n\r\nJune - August 2021\r\nHulki Okan Tabak",

There is a profound rabbit hole on that topic but Cuddle is more basic, more innocent, gullible even, modestly carnal, mostly emotional.\r\n\r\nCuddle's front layer is an abstraction from a segment of a project. That piece has been re-created in my imaginary depiction of two people hugging, holding, cuddling each other in the most basic confines of line-art abstraction.\r\n\r\nBehind the Cuddle runs a gamut of photographs for different times of the day as Async Art's engine throttles through the incessant 24 hour interval of our lives. Sunrise hits with a garden shot of flowers in the morning from 2020. Day invigorated with an image from 25 years ago of a sun casting shadows through shutters. Sunset is a stylization of a female figure from a 1990 photograph that went through an extensive 2021 Photoshop session. Night uses a public domain photo in a subtle abstract yet attractive manner.\r\n\r\nAll through the cuddle remains the constant. Our need to express and to be heard and to be cared and to care.

      "description": "Presenting to the viewer a dramatically charged scene of a killer robot. Based off of a painting of Rubens with the theme of the legend of a Saint, this painting becomes more than a critic of art history. Influenced also by the Artist's recent tours of Japan and China, multiple meanings can be extracted from the contemporary work originally titled,  \"The Revenge of Asia\"\nThe viewer is confronted with an armed robot and a fire breathing dragon, both reminiscent of mythology and legend that combine story elements from the west and east. This work of art also becomes part of a larger critique on current issues revolving around the relationship between these two powers. Combining also the past and present, the modern technologically advanced robot rides waves that remind the viewer of ancient Asian scroll paintings. Today, these waves could symbolize rising ocean levels. The horizon which is made gold, reminds us not only of the commerce of art history but also becomes a reflection of Asia's current pollution problems as it obscures the sun in its haze. The ruthless dictator and human rights violator Kim Jong-un placed alongside new and amazing technological advancements give rise to questions about the true purpose of this new technology and also which political leaders that could control them.\n\nSet to Tokyo time, in observance of the Olympic Games of 2021.\nThis artwork, which was originally created in 2012, and added to the blockchain a decade later, represents a shift from the immortal history of great painting as we move to a digital creator's economy.\nIronically, this artwork was conceived before the pandemic and the great rising tides that plague our earth and human condition.  Will the block-chain give rise to a larger awareness of the pressing issues of man-kind?\n",

It is an image I've re-imagined from public domain source and I thought a variation piece with Async Art's 24 piece 24 hour template would be a perfect piece to use for variations on the image. I believe the result turned out to be beautiful, interesting and somewhat striking while not being overtly loud. I hope you enjoy the creation as much as I do.\n\nShe VII for the Day minted by Athena Novo on Async Art, 2021",

A couple of years ago, I was strolling along an embankment with my artist friend, while we discussed art and its creators. One question in particular drove a wedge between us - what is more important for the creator, passion or patience? After a long discussion, we parted, each with his own opinion. A month later, I made this piece and sent it to him. Unfortunately, our communication has come to naught, however this discussion remains important to me.\n\nIn 2021, I completely reworked this piece, changing the shades and shapes, while only the essence remained the same. I also created a black & white version especially to show the detail and volume, as colour distracts attention from them.",

Rest of the night is the disturbing image of To Break Free with scant hope of escape for the leading woman of the third act.\r\n\r\nPhotography by Hulki Okan Tabak from 2019. Photoshoot from dress rehearsals of a dance project about three women and the hardships they endured. Edited various times with final edit on June 2021 to be minted on Async Art.\r\n\r\nThis has been a very intense photoshoot and gorgeous performance by the whole group.

The struggle happens in day and night. A man wants to speak but is afraid. He thinks, sinking into his thoughts, imagining scenarios in which they are in love... The women believes she is at fault, as the man does not speak to her, but struggles to engage herself to break to the root. Love deteriorates, and the push becomes greater. Help then. This artwork stems from the society that we today live in. Should the women make the move first and accept to get rejected, or should the man do so accepting that he might get rejected? Both should be seen as signs of encouragement.  Maybe there is a third hand helping.\n",

      "description": "During the lockdown, I stumbled upon the use of AI and the generation of visuals using GANs. I began getting intrigued by questions like how does a machine think up visuals? What goes through its “mind/consciousness” while doing so? Does it possess a mind or a consciousness like humans do? If these machines could think, could they feel too?\n\nThis last question stuck in my head and became something I constantly found myself returning to. I began thinking more; could I create an NFT piece that could emote and feel? \n\nI researched how emotions work in humans to see if I could replicate the same as an interactive Async piece. Human emotions are due to a few chemical components; to break it down, it is predominantly controlled by neurotransmitters. The most common ones are Adrenaline, Dopamine, Serotonin and the rest being Noradrenaline, GABA, Acetylcholine, Glutamine. Each neurotransmitter controls different emotions in a human being. \n\nThis piece tries to emulate the functioning of the human brain. The emotional mess/bliss that every human lands up with is due to different compositions and combinations of these chemical concoctions. Buyers could purchase each of these “neurotransmitters” as individual layers, therefore giving them a chance to interact with the piece and decide how it \"feels”, what it feels. \n\nWith each layer owned by different human identities, they interact and their own emotions at that point of time could reflect in the changes they make to the piece. This gives rise to unique and infinite possibilities, just like the human mind.  \n\nAfter all, what is existence if one cannot feel?",

      "description": "Historically, carpets play a significant role in forming Azerbaijan & Middle East’s heritage and aesthetics. Different carpet schools share the same ornamental forms, such as geometric patterns, floral motifs, and calligraphic shapes, but some of the combinations are specific to certain regions. Today, the word ‘pattern’ is often associated with machine algorithms that recognize regularities in data. Orkhan designed an AI algorithm to analyze carpet designs and traditional ornaments. After processing the collected data, the neural network system is producing imaginary patterns that could have been Azerbaijani or similar, but all of them never really existed. The installation The Idea of Saving Aesthetics explores data as a fruitful and yet thoroughly problematic resource for artistic inspiration in the turbulent epoch of global nomadism, uneven cultural diffusion, and rising nationalist movements.\n\nAccording to historic data and memo records of European researchers and travelers, Mediaeval Azerbaijan was one of the major carpet hubs of the Orient, and after the Islamic Golden age, most of the middle eastern carpet patterns and ornaments became popularized by the western countries. While in Azerbaijan, carpet weaving was primarily a dominating form of art, with the traditions and skills carefully passed over from one generation to another, through developing and improving methods of making and spreading crafted symbols. By approaching these representations of our nation’s cultural history, with the help of AI, we get a dialogue between the future and the past, dystopian and utopian.\n\nIn this exhibition, the artist highlights the source and meaning of ornaments with the background history and regional source of them. During the exhibition experience, visitors will be able to witness current locations and uses of the embroideries all over the world.\n\nPremiered at Moscow contemporary art Biennale 2019. Moscow, Russia.\nThis art installation has been in the collection of Russian Federation The State Tretyakov Gallery since 2020.",

My work is centered in a sense of wonder and curiosity, and takes its cues from forces of nature - in this case, life at a cellular level.  The cellular metaphor encourages me to think of hidden mysteries that can only be seen and appreciated by looking deeper, past the surface, into the depths of a thing.   Careful attention and thoughtful consideration so often seems a discarded thing of the past, and I find it impoverishing.  In my images, I hope to speak to the heart, reminding us all to stop and see, slow down and appreciate.

The hand-made photogram is one of the subjects that compose this piece, and this photogram is not for sale separately whatever in the crypto world or the real world.\n\nChanges is the only thing that hasn’t been changed. From time to space to the thoughts of human beings are constantly changing. I transformed a Silver Gelatin Photogram (a piece of physical photograph made of alternative photographic processes) into a digital image that even can produce endless changes. This is based on the change in my way of seeing the world. It is difficult for individuals to completely isolate themselves from their own inherent culture, this ingrained imprint not only stems from families but also social and historical influences. Besides, the rapid innovation of science and technologies directly drives the world today to inevitably facing collisions and fusions in multiculturalism. Studying classical philosophical text allows me to apply the dialectical method to tease those open questions, and finally ground on my artworks. All things complement each other and balance in the collision. Changes is the key. Isn’t the development of human civilization that come to the present evolve in indistinct ways?\n\nContents included #5642 Master Layer (Day), #5642 Master Invert Layer (Night), #5642 the invert version of the Master Solarize Layer (Sunrise), #5642 Master Solarize Layer (Sunset).",

The specific lyrics which relate to the painting are:\n\n“Choose and renounce throwing chains to the floor\nKill or be killing faster sins correct the flow\nCasting giant shadows off vast penetrating force\nTo alter via the war that’s seen\nAs friction spans the spirit’s wrath ascending (slowly) to redeem…\n\n…The fist will run\nGrasp metal to gun\nThe spirit sings in rushing tones we gain the battle drum\nOur cries will shrill, the air will moan and crash into the dawn\nThe pen won’t stay the demon’s wings, the hour approaches\nPounding out the devil’s sermon”\n",

Loosely based on his imagery and more firmly based on the sense of foreboding creeping in to his work, the digital sketches here are an extension of Nussbaum inspired characters I have created and minted from 2020 to 2021.\r\n\r\nThe original names I had given to the underlying artworks for this final collective piece were:\r\nSunrise - That Which is in Limbo\r\nDay - Limbo One Sketch\r\nSunset - One of the Elders\r\nNight - Dreaming of Another One\r\n\r\nAs they are integrated in to this Async Art piece, their identity becomes a collective now as part of Sketches from a Time of Conflict. They will not appear as individual mints so I provided the names to the prospective Collector as part of the artwork's history.\r\n\r\nI've terribly enjoyed working on this material and I hope you shall enjoy hosting for a future generation and passing on the word of peace, understanding and constructive affirmation of diversity even in times of duress.\r\n\r\nSketches from a Time of Conflict\r\nMinted 2021 on Async Art by Hulki Okan Tabak\r\n",

Deep in the crouching mist lie their villages.\r\n\r\nI have spent a lifetime in the mountains. And if I had to do it all over again, I would still choose to spend my life here. Most Garhwali cultivators are poor, some are very poor. And yet these are cheerful people, sturdy and with wonderful powers of endurance.\r\n\r\nThis 4 series of artwork readily focus on theme of Garhwal processed in Generative art and digitally distorted manner with a vision from my eyes. Eyes that still have a vision to do something for its culture, its soil. Eyes that won't rest until Myaru Garhwal (My Garhwal) becomes a key point for attraction of entire world in terms of tourism and economy towards its culture.",

An anonymous poem captured the mood of the times. \"A bird with one body but two beaks, pecking itself to death.\" However, it was also a time of significant cultural and economic growth. This was when legendary samurai like Saito Dosan, Takeda Shingen, Uesugi Kenshin, Tokugawa Ieyasu and Oda Nobunaga emerged as major players, consolidating the territories of their respective domains while encouraging the practice of arts like classical painting, architecture and the tea ceremony.\n\nThis is the first in a series of artworks that explore the Samurai of the Sengoku Period. A place of beauty and serenity and despair, torment and violence. Each layer has between 30 to 37 states that allow you to change the feel of the work. Change the background, the clouds, the birds, the insects, the fog, the skull, the helmet or the mask. There are over 416,965,528 non-repetitive combinations available in this work.

I was inspired to create this piece(s) regarding my experienced struggles of the heart. Some people are monsters, some are nice, some are just evil and some just want to be with you. They all try to reach your heart, whether they want to love it or poison it. My imagination ran wild thus I was able to recreate these artworks with passion and a tiny bit of narcissism. I have put them all into one grand master piece. Here are the names for each piece:\n\n12:00. Quiet, 13:00. The Break, 14:00.  I keep forgetting, 15:00. Who needs a heart when you got a frog. 16:00. Invasion, 17:00. Forgotten, 18:00. They all love me, 19:00. Reaching High 20:00. Finally I am warm. 21:00. Mother, where did you go?, 22:00. Keep away, 23:00. Whispering, 24:00. Light under the water. 1:00. Drowning Church, 2:00. Cold, 3:00. Judgement, 4:00. Grandfather, 5:00. I am lost, 6:00. Here, Kitty..., 7:00. Protection, 8:00. Narcolepsy, 9:00. Heart Attack, 10:00. My love, I am all yours, 11:00. Broken Heart.\n\n\n“The Heart wants what it wants - or else it does not care”\n― Emily Dickinson \n",

      "description": "In 2152 the first new world mission arrived on a planet located within it's sun's habitable zone that had become known to all as 'Thades'. Virtually the same distance from its own sun as our Earth is to its sun, the landing team hoped to discover a new society. Instead, what they found were the archaeological remains of a long dead technologically advanced civilization.\n\nHowever, one of the alien artefacts discovered and still in working order within many of the crumbling structures on the planet, was a cycling projection of 24 images that have come to be known collectively as, 'The Timepiece of Thades'.\n\nMuch conjecture has been made over the true meaning of the symbols, but most most experts agree that each image was an individual visual representation of an hour on the planet, with the possibility of a further division of each of these hours by 5, as represented by the 5 glyphs that visually interact with one another. It has been also suggested that the Thadeans further divided their day into six 4 hour periods – as represented by the 6 changing backgrounds.\n\nThe Timepiece of Thades remains as the only working piece of technology ever to be found on the planet...\n\nArtist's notes: \n\nThe project started with the creation of 5 separate glyphs as clearly seen in the 12pm piece, I then rearranged and combined 5 glyph layers with each other, with a view to creating new forms and dynamic angles/juxtapositions that draw the viewer into each piece's composition.\n\nThe aim was to create a set of works that looked and felt as if they were alien artefact art that had simplistic roots based in a primitive time, yet that had also developed along with a technologically advanced society. The concept was that the pieces were used as a form of visual communication, in this case symbolizing the time of day on an alien civilization.\n\nFeatures:\n\n*Aspect Ratio of the artwork is created at 16:9, suitable for full-screen display on Apple TVs/Widescreen monitors/Smart TVs & Smart phones\n*Lossless PNG format utilized means no matter displayed large or small, the quality will be flawless\n*Timezone set to PST\n*Autonomously changes 24 times in a day, on the hour, every hour (forever)\n*Background also changes every 4 hours, a total of 6 times in 24 hours\n*Each hour's image is a 1 of 1 abstract piece of artwork within its own right\n*The first time I've used the landscape orientation for an NFT work\n*My particular CMYK Hexadecimal values used throughout\n*My first AsyncArt solo piece",

However, the work \"lichtkugel_schwarz\" was never published.\nAs of 2010, due to cancer, I hardly had any more opportunities to work artistically because I was tired and had to worry about livelihood, so there is a big gap in my résumé. However, I continued to follow the developments of the Internet / digital media art without making my own contribution.\nIn May/July 2021 I started to be interested in NFT, so I completely reworked this piece. I started to remove the Pixels and did experiments. \n\nI was never looking for a specific style, I am more interested in individual social and cultural topics, these are then processed selectively and then lead to a result: the image and the text. (Conceptual Art/image experiments). But I do love this work and all works with light.\n\nAsync Art shows Art, that changes over time, so this will be my first artpiece at Async Art: Master; Day + Sunrise + Sunset + Night\n3 Ownable Layers > not transparent (full JPG 3840x2160px;\ncomputer monitors, display panels, mobiles) display best on landscape screens\n\nBALL OF LIGHT by pjArtbasel 2021\nDay/Night Timezone (GMT-06:00) Central America; \nDay is shown from 6am to 7pm and Night is shown from 7pm to 6am. \nDimensions 3840x2160px HQ JPG",

This is a growing problem, with about 2 Million people only in Japan being isolated in their homes away from society, and increasing all over the planet. This piece tries to bring awareness and convey the asphyxiating feeling of not being able to leave your room, it talks about depression and difficult times, it is a mirror of your comfort zone. It´s also a celebration of the good old times and childhood memories and a realization that things get better.\n\nThis artwork consists of two layers, Day and Night, that help reinforce the feeling of being a Hikikomori. I started making this piece during this year´s lockdown, in the span of 5 months and hundreds of hours I designed, 3d modelled and textured each one of the hundreds of elements in the scene which have been meticulously curated to fit the same 90s aesthetic.",

The algorithmically generated terrain is here to represent the liminality of a space. Where is this place ? Does it have an essence ? It is a space without being a space. It is the other. The Monolith is the hero of this sensible realm.\n\nA generated world, which is perceptible by sight and all the senses, by the name of earth or air or fire or water, or any aggregates or constituents there of: rather, if we describe her as a Kind invisible and unshaped, all-receptive, and in some most perplexing and most baffling way partaking of the intelligible, we shall describe her truly.\n— Plato, Timaeus, 51a",

We were only just beginning to digitize real world objects and storing images in digital format. Back then I had the good fortune to become friends with some heavy hitters in the pioneering stages of our beloved industry. Fractals, computer generated art, virtual reality, even 3d rendering were known only to the supernerds and geek club guys like me.  Even then for those with vision we saw that eventually we would be where we are now. Thanks to my contacts and their constant inspiration and moral support I spent 35+ years making cgi and everything digital media my career. Retired from professional life I am now focusing completely on my art. I can never forget a few things said to me by my mentors.\n\n\"Never worry about the technology to achieve your artistic vision. Concentrate on your art and the tech will be there whenever you are ready for it.\" - Cliff Johnson \"The Great OZ\"\n\n\"Pay no attention to what is popular or trendy. Find a style and own it. Always be willing to adapt when new tools come along but stay true to yourself and your vision.\" - Ken Musgrave \"Doc Mojo \n\n\"The best stuff can be found at the boundary between order and chaos. It is in this zone where the real action is.\" - Benoit Mandelbrot \"Uncle Benny\"\n\nThis dynamic 24 hour autonomous piece \"Vision of Persistence\" is dedicated to all the \"old guys\" that encouraged and mentored me all along the way.

Doctors are called to more than mere technical proficiency, but to presence and engagement that suffuses an entire conversation; compassion, a quality paramount to patient welfare. It discards the notion that doctors need to maintain a professional distance from their patients.\nCombing through scientific literature reveals that doctor compassion does more than just calm the nerves; it boosts the survival chance of cancer patients , reduces post-surgery pain, and can boost the immune system, to name a few.\nCompassion binds together the doctor-patient relationship, a necessary kinship in managing and seeing through one's good chance of recovery.",

The hefty task is not alone in dealing with the intense pressure; it also lies in gradually cultivating the in-grown patience necessary to withstand one from stepping away from the many health catastrophes of people's lives. The instinct impels many to try one last time, to continue probing the solution. Here, the cause is greater than the burden of duty. Loads of empathy are requisites to rightly attuning mind and body for\nwork. It calls for perspective as to how life can easily pun out difficult for anyone, for our dear friend or loved, for anyone, ourselves included.\nI respect the courage and the character it takes to uphold this personal value; this art piece extends my recognition and lauds their commendable spirit of humanity.",

We often feel we are trapped inside a single day that repeats itself without end. But, by confining itself to the timeframe of day, my work reveals that is not time but our thoughts that entrap us. \n\n“Kylo Ren + the Divine Feminine” purposefully alternates between the mundane and the transcendental to reveal how the inescapable rhythm of dawn, noon, dusk, and night governs our physical and emotional hunger. \n\nThough any section could be the first, readers might consider starting at 6:00 am.

It was magical; the volumes of trust and the extent of willful vulnerability were astounding for our young minds.\nThis much confidence invested in doctors exists in no other profession.The pressure to deliver well on this much faith invested requires expert containment and the humane skill of radiating positive energy to the patients during their healing process.\nPerhaps this saying is true; a caring, present, and devoted doctor has the job done half-done.",

It is a work of struggle, of celebration, of premonition and of jubilation. \n\nAn initial composition of color was created by Shinji Akhirah which helped to inform the delegation of sections via a randomizer. Each artist was randomly assigned an area on the canvas to complete their part. This collaboration captures original artwork by 38 different artists - infusing each part of the piece with their own unique style to complete the 12 different animals and setting with the central focus being placed on the Ox (\"0x\" or \"ZeroX\" as he's occasionally referred to). \n\nWe present you with the \"Year of The 0x\" - a celebration of creativity, Chinese astrology and the globally collaborative CryptoArt movement.",

The commitment satiates and rewards outside the promise of money. Our world has seen a growing belief in Karmic energy, a belief that the universe rewards with either a tangible blessing or a strong sense of fulfillment when you do good. The same phenomenon strongly identifies with the lives of some medical workers who heartily embrace the heaven-vested duty assigned to them by the universe.\nPost any successful yet complex surgery, a sense of fulfillment floods the surgical team, and for once, life feels intimate, and its possibilities are sensed with greater intensity. This band darted into plains of positivity where consistent hope is cultivated and courage to expect the good is adopted.",

The creature rebuilds the dome every day, and each day it is reclaimed by the sands. The work portrays the inherent meaninglessness of our toil, which eventually passes with time. It poses the question: knowing this, why do we continue to build what we build?\n\nThe creature was crafted from pipe cleaners, felt, yarn, clothes pins, and a large bead. It was photographed in the physical world in front of a green screen and inserted into a virtual environment. This environment, including the house, props, and lighting, were rendered in real-time out of a game engine. The process combines physical and digital worlds as a reflection of our own way of existing in both spaces.\n\n“What has been will be again, what has been done will be done again. There is nothing new under the sun.”",

Eyes that haven’t yet been formed; new eyes that no longer know how to ‘look to our future” for hope and possibilities. Eyes swimming in pools of uncertainties brought by Covid19.\n\nOur Instagram lives and our materialistic obsessions are now unimportant and breaking apart at the seams. Nails unpainted, unkempt hair with new natural roots growing out of our scalps. spring fashion lines left the rack, are locked up in retail stores collecting dust. All were deemed unimportant by Covid19. \n\nWe are left to self reflect, face ourselves, slow down, and toss and turn at night with vivid crackling dreams alive with messages screaming from our subconscious. A newly formed focus on symbols and images, not yet fully understood, brought to you by Covid19. \n\nOur connection to nature and the world around us is only now beginning to be understood. We thought we were separate, but now we know we are one. We were never masters of this universe because nature was never ours to master. Fractured plants, roaming animals, the unpolluted sky, the contaminated dirt, seeping in and out of our bodies. Sequestered in our homes, our minds begin to change, open up, and fracture with confusion; scattered with former motivations that are no longer valuable. We float in a sea of unknowns, covering our faces with psychological and real masks. Covid19 is a virus that makes reliability and safety unknown. In a sparkly shiny isolated dreamy space —  how will we prophesize our new future and manifest in an uncertain one?",

Afghanistan became a kind of Eden - a lush and exotic garden inhabited by beautiful and heroic people - for beyond my reach but enriching my world.  Would that I could today enrich the real world of my unknown, but beloved sisters there.  I weep, and pray that Afghanistan may see a new dawn.

      "description": "Questgiver is a satirical app developed by paleh0rs3 to ask the question:\n\n\"What if mid-conversation we could pull up an Uber-style app to break free from the imposed limits on acceptable thoughts?\"\n\nIn almost any social situation we're implicitly forced to choose from a set of response options as if we're non-playable characters, or quest givers, in a video game. And often this is for good reason: the human mind harbors darkness and despair that our fellow citizens are usually best left unaware of.\n\nWe often joke about living in a simulation to conjure apprehension, but on some axes, we're most comfortable when the options are limited and predictable.\n\nQuestgiver's UI was handcrafted for the 16:9 aspect ratio optimal for displaying Async pieces on televisions and digital frames. The concept for a \"Questgiver Terminal\" was inspired by the \"expected waiting time\" screens for public transport / ridesharing apps in high-end lobbies. It gives a publicly observable screen on which passersby can view nearby Questgivers engaging in uncomfortable conversations.\n\nEach conversation features completely fake yet convincing human portraits generated via AI on ThisPersonDoesNotExist.com. In addition, the conversations utilize a stylized \"dialog tree,\" which is actually a method employed to model NPC interactions in video games. Each dialog tree is spawned by a remark from the non-Questgiver. The first column of the tree contains two \"socially acceptable\" responses that have been greyed out in favor of the transgressive response. The app then generates a predicted counter-response to the Questgiver's unacceptably choice words, which prompts three more even worse options to become available.\n\nSince it was designed to be shown on a public display in a well-trafficked area, the concept was a natural fit for the 24H Async template. At each hour of the day, a new Questgiver is highlighted to emulate the dynamic nature of conversations occurring 24/7.\n\nSo go find your nearest Questgiver Terminal today.\n\nMaybe you'll even strike up a conversation over what you both witness...\n\nMAP ATTRIBUTION\nQuestgiver utilizes a static snapshot of a map from Mapbox\nTo learn more, visit https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/ and http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright\n© Mapbox, © OpenStreetMap",

All of these works consist of photographs taken by me in January 2020. It is the time of Lunar New Year, Wuhan lockdowns, and the very first signs of the virus in Europe.\n\nMarylebone was originally an Ancient Parish formed to serve the manors (landholdings) of Lileston (in the west - which gives its name to modern Lisson Grove) and Tyburn in the east. The parish is likely to have been in place since at least the twelfth century and will have used the boundaries of the pre-existing manors. The boundaries of the parish were consistent from the late twelfth century to the creation of the Metropolitan Borough which succeeded it. (Wikipedia)",

These ghostly splinters are a stark reminder of the legacy of colonial history; their missing parts scattered around the museums of the world, from London to The Louvre. \n\n‘History’s Monsters’ is an attempt to glue history back together, collecting broken fragments of ancient Greek sculptures, statues and grotesques from across the world and reconstructing them in a horrifying game of Exquisite Corpse. The Frankensteins that are created in turn recall the many gods and hybrids that populate ancient Greek mythology, from Medusa to the Minotaur, and from Cerberus to the Cyclops. These are history’s monsters. \n\nThe piece consists of twelve monsters. Each monster changes colour and texture depending on whether it’s night or day in Athens, Greece (where the Acropolis Museum stands), to create twenty-four unique images, metamorphosing every hour - a macabre clock. The first visual creation of London-based band HMLTD, and following their Async Music genesis piece 'LEAVING', 'History's Monsters' will play an integral role in their upcoming second album campaign.",

All of these works consist of photographs taken by me in January 2020. It is the time of Lunar New Year, Wuhan lockdowns, and the very first signs of the virus in Europe.\n\nMarylebone was originally an Ancient Parish formed to serve the manors (landholdings) of Lileston (in the west - which gives its name to modern Lisson Grove) and Tyburn in the east. The parish is likely to have been in place since at least the twelfth century and will have used the boundaries of the pre-existing manors. The boundaries of the parish were consistent from the late twelfth century to the creation of the Metropolitan Borough which succeeded it. (Wikipedia)",

For the geometric patterns, and strange attractors I worked with Jwildfire. It was then colour graded in Davinci Resolve. Finally  I whittled down the best combinations which made a significant diverse difference to the master layer. All the layers are meant to be mixed and matched. Enjoy playing with it!",

      "description": "As the hours pass the moon will slowly reveal itself becoming a bright light in the nights sky before eventually shrouding itself in darkness again!\n\n\nA little about how I  created this:\nStarted with images taken from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) and modeled them in After Effects from there I added points of light that gradually come towards the camera. After I was happy with the look here I edited it further on my phone using an app called Glitch Studio to bring out some of the blues and reds. This was also where I layered in some noise, dithering, and got the overall aesthetic down. For this piece I imported the finished video which was almost 2 minutes long  back into AE and sped it up to be 24 secs long and exported a frame every 60 frames which ended out working out to a complete loop! \n\n",

Long thought to be a copy of a lost original veiled with overpainting, it was rediscovered, restored, and included in Luke Syson's major Leonardo exhibition at the National Gallery, London, in 2011–12. Christie's claimed just after selling the work that most leading scholars consider it to be an original work by Leonardo, but this attribution has been disputed by other specialists, some of whom posit that he only contributed certain elements.\n\nThe painting depicts Jesus in an anachronistic blue Renaissance dress, making the sign of the cross with his right hand, while holding a transparent, non-refracting crystal orb in his left, signaling his role as Salvator Mundi and representing the 'celestial sphere' of the heavens. Approximately thirty copies and variations of the work by students and followers of Leonardo have been identified. Preparatory chalk and ink drawings of the drapery by Leonardo are held in the British Royal Collection.\n\nThe painting was sold at auction for US$450.3 million on 15 November 2017 by Christie's in New York to Prince Badr bin Abdullah, setting a new record for most expensive painting ever sold at public auction. Prince Badr allegedly made the purchase on behalf of Abu Dhabi's Department of Culture and Tourism but it has since been posited that he may have been a stand-in bidder for his close ally and Saudi Arabian crown prince Mohammed bin Salman. This follows late-2017 reports that the painting would be put on display at the Louvre Abu Dhabi and the unexplained cancellation of its scheduled September 2018 unveiling. The current location of the painting has been reported as unknown but a June 2019 report stated that it was being stored on bin Salman's yacht, pending completion of a cultural center in Al-`Ula and an October 2019 report indicated it may be in storage in Switzerland.

Painted during Cézanne's final period in the early 1890s, there are five paintings in the series. The versions vary in size, the number of players, and the setting in which the game takes place. Cézanne also completed numerous drawings and studies in preparation for The Card Players series.\n\nThe series is considered by critics to be a cornerstone of Cézanne's art during the early-to-mid 1890s period, as well as a \"prelude\" to his final years, when he painted some of his most acclaimed work.\n\nEach painting depicts Provençal peasants immersed in their pipes and playing cards. The subjects, all male, are displayed as studious within their card playing, eyes cast downward, intent on the game at hand. Cézanne adapted a motif from 17th-century Dutch and French genre painting which often depicted card games with rowdy, drunken gamblers in taverns, replacing them instead with stone-faced tradesmen in a more simplified setting. Whereas previous paintings of the genre had illustrated heightened moments of drama, Cézanne's portraits have been noted for their lack of drama, narrative, and conventional characterization. Other than an unused wine bottle in the two-player versions, there is an absence of drink and money, which were prominent fixtures of the 17th-century genre. \n\nThe models for the paintings were local farmhands, some of whom worked on the Cézanne family estate, the Jas de Bouffan. Each scene is depicted as one of quiet, still concentration; the men look down at their cards rather than at each other, with the cards being perhaps their sole means of communication outside of work. One critic described the scenes as \"human still life\", while another speculated that the men's intense focus on their game mirrors that of the painter's absorption in his art.

      "description": "This is Nu Day in Her Own Way from The Most Expensive Artworks Project collaboration by Athena Novo and Mad Monk.\n\nIt is a remix of Modigliani's Nu Couche with a dose of some more Modigliani . It is No 10 (skipping a lot in between at will) in the project in parallel with its place on the list. Accordingly it has been last sold November 2015 in Christie's New York for USD 170 million. The seller was Laura Mattioli Rossi and the buyer was Liu Yiqian. \n\n...\n\nThe Most Expensive Artworks Project started with an idea and a web page on Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_expensive_paintings.\n\nAthena Novo and Mad Monk collaborated on \"doing something\" with the list. First idea was to make a common \"burn\" GIF. Step by step the original or an alternative version would be burned i.e. like a GIF. However the idea of destructing artworks did not appeal. Then glitching was cast off as the main tool for something more appealing was under consideration. It was the idea of remixing the artwork more freely - sometimes with itself and sometimes with others on the list (as a pre-condition to narrow the universe).\n\nConsequently AN and MM started to work on from the top of the list. Several results were obtained and from them, the story modes with multiple artworks will be minted on Async Art by Athena Novo while the single items (in GIF or JPG) will be minted on KnownOrigin by Mad Monk as a part of the collaboration.\n\n...\n\nNu couché (also known in English as Red Nude or Reclining Nude is a 1917 oil on canvas painting by the Italian artist Amedeo Modigliani. It is one of his most widely reproduced and exhibited paintings. (Wikipedia) ",

And we continue to fight with ourselves while looking for a subject, thing, person, ideology to which we can connect. Centuries have not changed its ordinary style in human psychology. One day we will realize that the only thing we can hold on to in the world is love. Until that happens, we will integrate with things. We will greet the insects. We will mix colors. And we will become alienated from those closest to us. We'll get lost in untidy dirty walls. After a while, the days become the same as the other days. Then hours are like days. Let's Think Now. Are our emotions a closet that we can open into the dark and show? Or how are we different from an insect trying to escape between things?",

In this artwork, the background is composed of two different layers, each with three different possible choices (layer A: white, burgundy or yellow layer B: white, blue or green) interacting together (the color of Layer B multiplies with the color of layer A) resulting in 9 potential background colors. Watch how the main element is perceived differently each time, depending on the underlying background. Even though, in reality the paint stays exactly the same no matter the background, it looks different based on its surroundings. Which relates to what we see in the \"real\" world, the truth being greatly influenced by its surrounding. \n",

      "description": "BRIEF: Abstract techno magical surrealist self-portrait with artist’s still-quite-feral kitty for Kitty Bungalow & Async Art.\n\nBACKGROUND: In a world governed by straight lines and rigid thought, a gentle curve can be disruptive. A soft bit of fur & flesh can make an awful mess out of a clean but heartless machine. \n\nINQUIRY: Proverbial wayward women (& kitties), hexes, vexes, and societal complexes: visually explore the symbolism, stigma, myth, and magic of feline &  feminine forms as repressed elements within a rigid societal infrastructure through abstract techno magical surrealism. Further probe the unconscious with 24 unique variations of color & detail; ranging from subtle to drastic differences. (programmed to change every hour throughout a 24 hour period). \n\nThe juxtaposition of organic & digital shapes creates contrast and highlights the intrinsically awesome power of conscious endogenous life forms in the Universe — opening up room for broader meditation on the extant tension & interplay between the permanence of chaos & the impermanence of order — and how grounding our bodies IRL through physical connection & affection can anchor us, support us, and offer love when we are at our most vulnerable; fostering curiosity, play, resilience, and space for hearts to open, shift, and heal. \n\nWhen viewed through different lenses, filters, or contexts, things, people, places, images, symbols, and ideas, can take on new meaning, depth, and texture. 24h CATastrophe AveRTed is a call to reflect, observe, witness, to be present with the unknown, with growth, change, and evolution under the sun. May this piece serve as reminder to pause & look deeper, to be slow to judgment; and above all, to be kind; to one another and, of course, to be kind to kitties — especially the wayward ones. <3\n",

      "name": "Uttarakhand",
      "description": "Located on the shivalik range of Himalayas. Uttarakhand is a state in northern part of India. It is often referred to as the \"Devbhumi\" (literally \"Land of the Gods\").\nUttarakhand's name is derived from the Sanskrit words uttara (उत्तर) meaning 'north', and khaṇḍa (खण्ड) meaning 'land', altogether simply meaning 'Northern Land'.\n\nThe native people of Uttarakhand are generally called Uttarakhandi and sometimes specifically either Garhwali or Kumaoni depending on their place of origin in either the Garhwal or Kumaon region. Regional languages of Uttarakhand are Garhwali, which is spoken by 23% of the population mostly in the western half of the state, Kumaoni, spoken in the eastern half and native to 20%, both closely related languages of the Central Pahari languages, and the Jaunsari of the Western Pahari family, whose speakers are concentrated in Dehradun district in the southwest and make up 1.3% of the state's population. \n\nThere are many ancient temples, forest reserves, national parks, hill stations, and mountain peaks that draw large number of tourists. There are 44 nationally protected monuments in the state.\nAlso many regional festivals are celebrated here, Harela is one of them. Harela has a great significance in Kumaon. This symbolizes a new harvest and the rainy season. It has become common practice to attribute a slogan of – \"Save The Environment\" to Harela. Schools in Uttarakhand often encourage their students to plant saplings, either at home, in the school or with the support of local officials. In Kumaun, the two celebrations during Navratri – first during Chaitra Navratri in the month of Chaitra, and second during Sharad Navratri in the month of Ashwin, is also considered to be connected to Harela.\n\nThe scarcity of water is still a major problem in Uttarakhand. Agricultural land remains barren because of a lack of irrigation facilities in the state, while water is not even available for everyday household chores. In villages, women have to walk for miles every day to fetch water.\nThe need for responsible tourism and construction in the mountains has long been overlooked. Besides unemployment and migration, lack of power and other infrastructures like road constitute major electoral issues in the state. \n\nOut-migration in Uttarakhand can primarily be attributed to a combination of push and pull factors like the lack of employment, low income, subsistence agriculture, better opportunities for employment and children's education, etc.\nI sometimes feel these hills of Uttarakhand wants to speak something to me.\nThey want me to tell their story . They want me to describe the condition of Uttarakhand and hope I can bring a change in its developing community.\n\nTo the cruel world who only thinks about themselves, I wanted to be something else.\nTo change lifestyle of people of my Uttarakhand by improving economy through Crypto.\nBecause when you realize art is not just in canvas but if your art can change/improve someone lifestyle that is the real art and I am continuously striking myself to achieve that level of perfection.\n\nArtists - 1.

      "description": "When Duchess retired from Kittywood, she bought an old prop house from a friend. Even though she made the decision not to take another acting job, she wanted to remain in the Business in some way. It had been her life since she was a kitten! \n\nOne morning at sunrise, Duchess was loading some furniture into her van at the back of the building, when she noticed 5 sleepy kittens huddled in the cold. She knew that homelessness was a problem in Kittywood (having experienced it firsthand herself) and decided to build a shelter at the prop house. \n\nKitty Tent City facilitates the adoptions and ensures that the kittens are neutered or spayed and receive their vaccines. Over the years, many of Duchess' clients have adopted her kittens. Many of the kittens have stayed on to work in the prop house, help her run the shelter or have gone into the Business themselves.\n\nOnce a year, Duchess hosts and emcees the Duchess Theatre Variety Show featuring all the kittens-in-residence. It is a fundraiser for all the homeless kittens in Kittywood. You can usually find agents and managers in the audience, scouting for an up-and-coming starlet. Sometimes Duchess even performs!\n\nThe 24 hour images are a rotation of The Duchess Theatre Variety Show in two 12 hour cycles. It is always night in Kittywood, so no matter what time it is where you are, you are part of the party. \n\n1   Sunset Boulevard\n2   House Party\n3   By the Light of the Silvery Moon\n4   Into the Night\n5   Midnight Express\n6   The Dark Side of the Moon\n7   LA Confidential\n8   Through the Glass Darkly\n9   Eyes Wide Shut\n10 Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans\n11 The World's a Little Blurry\n12 I gotta go to bed, it's too bright out\n\n\n\n \n",

Each slice can be thought as timeframes and the occupancy of the slices represent the units of them. Each day/night these charts start from the past when everything is sweetness and light and end with the current level of the global warming, which create a loop of awareness reminding us each day that we can't change the past and motivates us to take action for a better future.",

      "name": "Day Cat, Night Cat",
      "description": "\"Day Cat, Night Cat\" is my contribution for the Kitty Bungalow Charity event. With this piece I wanted to tell about the complex different personalities that cats can have.\n\nThe Day Cat is my parents cat called Peukku. It means thumb in Finnish and she got that name because she has one extra toe on all paws. She's lives in the countryside and has been outdoors cat for all of his life. Shes very cautious as outdoors cats need to be and runs away from most people, but shes known me from a small kitty and I can still nowadays approach her and give her some pats but she usually wants to keep a distance and is definitely not a cat to hold! Sometimes when its quiet and safe, she might go on my parents lap when they watch tv. In summertime she loves to just sleep somewhere in the meadows or in the barn. Her nails are sharp as needles and shes pretty good at catching prey.. although she has gained quite a lot of weight recently.\n\nThe night cat is my cat called Kelmi (hard to translate, something like criminal/mischievous in Finnish). He is few years old Bengal cat. Bengals are domesticated from the wild Asian leopard cats and behave like one! Like all Bengals, he is very energetic and playful and needs quite a lot of entertainment to keep him satisfied. His favorite game is to play fetch and has already learned to come literally poke me with his paws to start playing with him when my girlfriend takes our dog out for a walk (that's the time to play or otherwise the doggo steals the toy). He has also no problem keeping up wresting with our dog that's 4 times of his weight. Other fun traits: he loves going outdoors (with harness) to climb trees and he knows his feeding times well enough that before it he will come on my desk to poke me with his head, purrs and acts very lovable until he gets his food. Sometimes though during nighttime his Bengal dna can start to show up and he can get bit aggressive and attack us hoomans. That's the time when you just have to keep the cool and move him to another room to cool down. Overall Bengals are really intelligent and fun cats that can be very lovable but sometimes also bit pain in the ass so a good amount of patience is required with them! Good news, next month we are getting another Bengal kitty! ",

Never took it off for fear of losing it.\n\nWhen he got too old to perform magic, Magic Man left his home in search of an apprentice.\n\nDuring his travels, Magic Man encountered a world unknown to him. He loved and loathed what he saw. He desired and cried incessantly. His emotions were mixed, his magic wat patchy, his hat was ragged.\n\nI've met him during his travels. It was by the inn on the High Steppes that he was so tired that he fell asleep on foot when he stumbled in. I helped the keep carry him to a room that was to be his last. \n\nThe stories I heard from him changed my life. The brief encounter was so brief and deep at the same time that I lack words to describe it. His last words I shall take to my grave. His wishes are my wishes now. His travels were not in vain.\n\n...\n\nMagic Man on the Loose\nby Hulki Okan Tabak\n\nPhotography by Hulki Okan Tabak, January - February 2020\nDigital Painting variations and Photoshop editing by Hulki Okan Tabak, January - September 2021\nConcept and the story by Hulki Okan Tabak, September 2021",

She couldn't stop thinking what that old tabby had said though... he seemed so certain of his beliefs. Could it be that she was truly the grandaughter of the exile? The legends never mentioned anything more of Captain Aditi after his exile, and the rumor that he had been found by the most loyal soldiers of the Kung Paw; deep in the belly of Shao Mountain, dabbling with dark powers not meant for kitty kind. But then, there were conflicting theories about how kitties learned to change their form by light of day to one resembling that of the hoomans of ancient times. Not even the great royal mages could say with any certainty why kitties gained this ability, nor did they know for sure why it was only possible in daylight; most kitties simply accepted the common belief that it was a gift offered them by the Kitty God, whose gaze strays to the west when night falls. The uncertianty was too much to bear. She had overheard the royal mages speaking of a spell they'd discovered that may let them witness events of the past, If she WAS a descendant of Aditi, and assuming the rumors of his involvement with dark magics were true, then maybe, just maybe, she could harness the ancient captains power, now possibly flowing through her veins, and could succeed where the royal mages had failed. \n\nProtect her Kitty God, she is young and has too important a destiny...",

      "description": "Dark tourism is a concept where you visit the worlds most darkest places ever historically associated with death, tragedy and suffering.\nIn 2017, I've visited Chernobyl. Took the tour to visit Kiev, Pripyat, and Chernobyl Nuclear Reactor Site.\n\nThe ghost city of Pripyat was amazing. When the government back then declared an evacuation, people didn't have any time to take their belongings with them.\nAll they packed was their clothes in small bags.\n\nPripyat was one of the richest cities in the whole world back then as the wages of the workers of Nuclear site was enough for them to become wealthy.\nBut money didn't solve anything when, in 26th of April, 1986, the reactor exploded.\n\nThe abandoned Pripyat elementary school was also evacuated when the children were actually in classes.\nAnd the tour guide says that none of the items in there were ever touched or re-placed.\n\nThis 24 photos are all taken by @koklucinar and generated by eNFThusiast.\nIt's a portrait design. Hope you enjoy it with your Meurals or Apple TV's.\n\nAll original 24 photos, without the background frame details, will be provided upon request by the owner of this NFT.\n\nImportant Note: This is a programmable NFT. It contains 24 photos and it updates automatically every hour.\nCome back in about an hour later to see the next photo or view all photos with the Async Art's explorer.",

The occasion and the patron for Mozart’s composition remains unknown today and it was probably never performed within the span of his lifetime.\n\nAlmost 200 years later and in the same city of Vienna, the world’s musical capital, Mozart’s masterpiece has been remoulded to reflect society’s evolution into today’s postmodern artistic landscape, with the incorporation of bold and futuristic cutting-edge technologies.\n\nThe structure of the Mastertrack consists of four stems: Violin 1, Violin 2, Viola and Cello, with a total of five variations per stem. Layering different stem variations over one another leads to the creation of personally crafted, magical and unique tapestries of sound, closely related to Mozart’s original.",

Using four different lights I explore the archetypal vampire as it relates to cultural propaganda of European colonialism broadly and the fetishization of its legacy of entrenched power structures; including but not limited to the control of water, land, natural resources, human beings, language, monopoly on violence, infrastructure, and currency. \n\nINQUIRY:\n\nIn 1492 Columbus sailed the ocean blue,\nThe Niña, the Pinta, and the Santa Maria too.\nCarried by the wind across the open sea,\nBringing death, destruction, and disease.\n500+ years of genocide — it’s true.\nI see a vampire’s legacy.\nWhat about you?",

      "description": "BRIEF: This minimalist digitally hand-drawn stipple exploration of spiral formation grows an hour at a time; reaching its fullest coiled shape at midnight. \n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nSince the human story began, upon every continent & island inhabited by human beings there were people carving spirals into wood, metal, stone, and bone. From galaxies to our DNA, spirals are repeated endlessly throughout our Universe at macro & micro scales. These deceptively simple motions reveal the principle of parsimony — energy conservation — at play in the Cosmos. Derived from Latin parsimonia meaning \"sparingness, frugality, thrift,\" from pars-, the past-participle stem of parcere \"to spare, save, refrain from, use moderately\" and -monia, suffix signifying action, state, or condition. (Etymonline) \n\nINQUIRY:\n\nArt did not begin as an institutional construct; and it will not end with the (at times, seemingly inevitable) decline of modern technological human civilizations on Earth through waste & war. Can we learn something from the silent movements of our world? Does our technological cosmology accurately place us within an infinite garden? Can we put aside finite games of centralization & domination to humbly rebalance? Will we mirror our infinite nature and collectively embody simplicity before our time runs out? No matter our fate, the vast & dazzling patterns in which we reside and find our being will remain long after the last pixel blinks out of existence. ",

It was kind of natural that I wanted to incorporate that in my cryptoart creations. The desire led to a selection of public domain pieces out of copyright from the Library of Congress archives. I created all sorts of derivative pacifist and tongue-in-cheek works. So far I have only minted a handful on KnownOrigin.

      "description": "Exquisite Being is an artwork inspired by the drawing exercise “exquisite corpse.” In this piece, the body parts of the figure, and its background, can be changed to build new combinations. The three options for each body part and background represent distinct ideological forces that influence the development of society: they were inspired by the archetypes of The Industrialist, The Artist, and The Scientist.  Each archetype views the world and the development of their species through a different lens and set of values. \n\nThese archetypes were referenced in an essay written by a nineteenth-century French economic, political, and socialist thinker, Henri de Saint-Simon, in 1825. Henri de Saint-Simon coined one of the first uses of the French phrase “Avant Garde” to describe the role of artists in driving social change through their work. “We artists will serve you as an avant-garde, the power of the arts is most immediate: when we want to spread new ideas we inscribe them on marble or canvas.” In addition to artists, Henri de Saint-Simon saw scientists and industrialists (i.e., the businessman, the capitalist) as the three forerunners and shapers of society. \n\nThis artwork is a collaborative piece between the artist and the different owners. Together, the owners of each part of the creature contribute to one character that represents a whole group of beings in the early stages of development on a new planet. As they evolve, they will need to make many choices of what to build their new society around. Therefore, the owners will not only determine the creature’s look but their evolutionary trajectory, the future of their society, and by extension, the health of their planet. The effects of these choices will be explored in future artworks.\n\n“Exquisite Being” is a mixed media piece that combines physical hand-crafted characters with digital environments. Pipe cleaners, felt, yarn, clothes pins, and wooden beads were used to build each creature and their body parts. They were photographed in the physical world in front of a green screen and inserted into virtual environments. These environments, including the structures, props, and lighting, were rendered in real-time out of a game engine.",

      "description": "This piece was created in the likeness of the streets of Kyoto on a folding screen that’s the abstraction of the blockchain, created in the early days of blockchain technology.\n\nBlockchain’s true nature is a new system that is decentralized. It’s created from a combination including irreversible hash functions, miners, nodes, and chains for a trustworthy system.\n\nThe creator believed that the power of the system “is like a bunch of new, invisible hands of gods that were born from the common consciousness based on the trust between humans.”  The gods that keep the blockchain system intact isn’t a single god, but the many blockchain tokens, making it similar to the millions of spirits in Shinto. The basis of blockchain was created by people, but ideally, blockchain itself cannot be directly controlled by humans. (Though it might be possible if the system is imperfect.) The girl who is depicted on a large scale in this art is not a god, but rather a being like a future shrine maiden that can be used by god.\n\nHumanity can’t access the system directly, but they can connect to the system through the shrine maiden. Because of the maiden, the system is governed throughout the city, but there are also places outside that are not under the system. In order to make it obvious that this space is stateless, the buildings in the art are from all around the world. The shrine maiden’s appearance suggests that she is Japanese, just like the founder of blockchain, but her hair is pink, a color not found in nature, as well to imply statelessness. The general idea (god) of the ideal blockchain is firm, but its history is still quite short, so the shrine maiden is still a young, immature teenager doing this as a part-time job. She may make mistakes when the processes can’t be dealt with on the chain. Miners use cranes to maintain the basic structure of the system. They’re not working because of the orders to do that; instead they are private general contractors doing it for profit. The various cryptocurrencies and tokens are concealed in the system’s space like clouds, but that’s just all they are, and they represent the essence of the system itself. Exchanges in shops are transactions. At the time, on the web, the systems were different for the regular web and the blockchain web even though it was the same web. The blockchain web had practical use for cryptocurrency through the reliable demand, but after that the system was put in use in a wide variety of fields like entertainment and art, so the soul of the system was created within the virtual space of the web just like the Milky Way runs through the galaxy.",

In this work, he has trained an ai-algorithm on a large series of photographs of the wintery mountains surrounding his house. The algorithm learns from statistics on colours, angles, shapes and textures in the photographs to generate new, virtual views of something not quite unlike the Lofoten mountains. \n\nThe artist calls these generated, synthetic landscapes for \"Generic Landscapes\". In the work \"Generic Landscape, Lofoten, A Snow Storm Passing\", a snowstorm drifts over the mountains, obscuring and revealing them as it passes. The work changes each hour of the day, to reveal a different aspect of the winterly storm.",

      "description": "\"A Disappeared Movement\" is a performance art project in which the artist acts as a guide and leads the participants to disappear from Xingfu Street. It was launched in 2020, in which the artist spent 6 months investigating the surveillance in the Xingfu Street district in Beijing. He delved into the blind spots of each surveillance camera, creating a set of maps that enable participants to avoid surveillance, and releasing it to the public for free. Later, a fire of wide spread social controversy was ignited due to the reports from multiple world media, such as BBC, SCMP HongKong, France Télévisions, The Globe and Mail, The Times, Dutch Telegraph, Tokyo Shimbun, etc. Subsequently, the Chinese government intervened, investigating all participants of the art project and giving them admonition. Since then, reports and exhibitions of \"A Disappeared Movement\" have been banned in China.  \nNow \"A Disappeared Movement\" will forever exist on the Blockchain as a piece of Programmable Art.\n\n《一场消失的运动》是艺术家邓玉峰在 2020 年花 6 个月的时间调查北京的幸福大街街区的所有摄像头,并研究每个摄像头的死角,创作一套能躲避摄像头监视的路线图,免费给大众使用。艺术家以“导游”的方式带领参与者一起消失在幸福大街的行为艺术项目。后因 BBC、香港南华早报、法国电视台、加拿大环球邮报、 英国泰晤士报、荷兰电讯报、日本东京新闻等几十家的世界媒体的报道引发了广泛的社会争议。 随后，中国警方介入，对艺术项目的所有参与者进行调查并给予警告。 此后，“消失的运动”的报道和展览在中国被禁止。\n现在《一场消失的运动》以可编程艺术的形式永远存在于区块链上。",

The infinite possibilities when he or she stands in front of the blank canvas in the studio. Every color pick or a brush stroke presents a\nfork in the road. The artist keeps exploring, having no idea where the road might lead him/her. Composing, constructing, deconstructing, and rebuilding; brushing,\nsmearing, covering, and erasing; trying to get to a place that feels right.\nWhile all 24 paintings start with the same basic idea, each ends up in a very different place. Each painting becomes a unique journey not so much about the time of the day but about the artist’s mood at that hour. There is no one painting\nthat is perfect; rather, each one is a unique journey.\nThe artist stays out of the frame most of the time. He appears only once, on one\npanel, sometime late at night.",

A voyage that connects the past, beholds the present and accompanies into the future, Pann is the beginning of a journey into the world of performed, programmable art. This 30-minute piece of music written in Tamil, was commissioned and produced by Metapurse and is a first of its kind NFT from India. It had its premiere in New York’s Terminal 5 on the 4th of November 2021 at Dreamverse, the world’s largest NFT exhibition curated by Metapurse. Pann became the ambient music for this historic event that merged the physical and digital realms for the first time, showcasing the pinnacle of NFT art of more than 150 artists from around the world.\r\n\r\nWoven from nine layers of music, each having several variants within it, the Pann master track captures a fresh collaborative performance of 40 musicians and visual artists.  It can be heard in 19440 different combinations, making it a dynamic piece of music with artwork done by Susha, Ghana N B and Vidhya Vijay that evolve along with every changing state of music. While most of the variants were recorded at 2barQ Studios, Chennai, Tamil Nadu by Sujith Sreedhar and Divine Joseph, the cherry on the cake is the live performance of some of the musical and art variants captured during the Dreamverse experience.",

This is drawing blindly; it is difficult to depict something recognizable other than line and color. From time to time, I finish the images in a photo editor. Dandelion is a work from the Narcissus series. The series is united by the presence of an abstract image of a flower in each piece. The theme of the series is Self-concept. \n",

The dataset from this series includes 300 photograms I made in the darkroom and 300 digital paintings I drew.\n\nThe concept of Relativity dearly changes my way of seeing and creating. When I hold light source on the Black & White photographic enlarging paper in the darkroom, I come over a sort of illusion that I am drawing. Even though I know that I'm making photographs because each beam of light represents its time and space. Painting is the outlet for my feelings. When I am drawing on the AI-generated image on the computer, the emotion comes and goes, just as the light only lasts for a second and never comes back. For me, this series is neither photography nor painting. It's a kind of new form.\n\n\nArtwork Title: Inwardness #452067\nDate of Artwork: 2021\nDimension: 3840 pixel x 3840 pixel\nType of Work: Programmable Art (Photogram, Digital Painting, GANs Algorithm trained images)\nDate of Dataset: 2021\nEdition: Unique",

Elements of this project were captured days prior to minting the artwork including New York City landscapes captured by Coldie. We believe that important experiences can be from long ago as well as a day ago and they hold the same historical significance. The visual vernacular of John Van Hamersveld shares both a realistic and surrealistic vision of what is possible in the real world, as well as the dream world.\n\nThe artwork created is meant to bring the viewer and collector inside of our shared dream reality and allow for the story to be visually told through the collector who owns each layer. The variety of options give the opportunity for the layer owner to express their current feelings about the artwork and share in real-time how it affects the total artwork. ",

      "description": "\nIdentify your mood. To change your mood, you need to realize what you are thinking and feeling. This way you can decide if you need to change your mood to one that best suits your situation.\n\nTo identify a mood, stop to think about what you are feeling and why. Put those feelings into words, like, \"wow, I'm very passionate right now! \" or \"I feel very lonely...\" You can say this to yourself silently, out loud, or to someone else.\n\nAccept what you feel. After you name your emotion, understand yourself by feeling the way you do. It's perfectly okay (and it's natural!) For you to feel vulnerable, hurted, deceived…or by the was, full of glamour, love and passion. All emotions are acceptable and understandable. But you don't have to hold on to feeling that way.

She dreamed of land, a spacious house, fresh air, organic food, and endless meadows without boundaries, free of evil and violence, free of toxins and environmental hazards, free of poverty, racism, and sexism . . . just free. She never talked about how we might create such a world, nor had she connected her vision to any political ideology.

But in certain situations, we want to run away from freedom, maybe because we are tired and need someone else to talk about our dreams and fantasies. At that time we need a home and family as a place to return to. This work is based on my mixed media abstract painting on canvas. Then I recreate it on the computer. Abstract makes me enjoy and free to do what I want. You are also free to interpret it.\n",

      "description": "I have been creating images of icons from my childhood memory in a thematic series called 'what are they looking at.\" While exploring these images I realized that a kind of education happened from watching these images in pop culture and I began to paint them using the hybrid approaches of both analogue and digital processes. As I was painting, I reflected on those distant fuzzy memories of seeing these icons on TV, going to their concerts, and reading about them in teen magazines. What had they taught me? This series originally painted on found glass represents those TV screens and, in turn, the iPhone and computer screens we look at now. I invite the viewer to look through this personal homage to my childhood pop iconsand reflect on how culture has changed, how the messaging has regressed and consider what are we looking at now?",

      "description": "This is a series of images depicting the sun rising over New York City, and the ramp that leads into the Lincoln Tunnel, as photographed from Weehawken, NJ -taken on 1.1.2017\n\nThe timing of the series is based on the Eastern Standard Time zone (New York)- the sun rises slowly into the morning hours and then goes back down slowly into the hours of the night based on 24 images, each assigned to a specific hour of the day.\n\nThe curved road-ramp pictured in the bottom left of the image is essentially the busiest half-a-mile stretch in the whole East Coast, every single morning of the year, as it is the main route that commuters take into New York City for work if they are travelling by vehicle.  \"The Lincoln Tunnel, named after President Abraham Lincoln, is one of the busy roadways, with upwards of 120,000 cars passing through every day. The Tunnel’s separate bus lane sees about 1,700 buses every morning.\" (2017)\n\nThese images of the ramp leading into the Lincoln Tunnel are especially unique because they were taken on the morning of New Years Day, 2017.  New Years Day each year is the only time of the year that this ramp is not entirely backed up with traffic by vehicles travelling into New York City.  One day every year, this roadway can be found in a quiet and peaceful state, and only for a few hours- if you're awake to catch it from the night before.\n\nAnother unique quality of this image is that this view will absolutely never be seen again- and that is because after 2017, the building that is seen being constructed in the foreground of the Empire State building was completed, and now blocks the view of the Empire State Building from Weehawken, NJ, and the Lincoln tunnel ramp.  Many other buildings have also been constructed which now take away from a lot of the beauty that I once attributed to this skyline as seen from Weehawken and the Lincoln Tunnel.\n\nGenerations of my family and myself have used this ramp and tunnel countless times to travel into the city, and this view will always hold a special place in my heart.",

His identifying implement is the thunderbolt and his primary sacred animal is the eagle,[13] which held precedence over other birds in the taking of auspices[14] and became one of the most common symbols of the Roman army (see Aquila). The two emblems were often combined to represent the god in the form of an eagle holding in its claws a thunderbolt, frequently seen on Greek and Roman coins.[15] As the sky-god, he was a divine witness to oaths, the sacred trust on which justice and good government depend.\" -- Wikipedia \n",

This series integrates the results of my research which are photograms, Mixed Media artworks, and AI-generated images. The dataset from this series includes 300 photograms I made in the darkroom and 300 digital paintings I drew.\n\nThe concept of Relativity dearly changes my way of seeing and creating. When I hold light source on the Black & White photographic enlarging paper in the darkroom, I come over a sort of illusion that I am drawing. Even though I know that I'm making photographs because each beam of light represents its time and space. Painting is the outlet for my feelings. When I am drawing on the AI-generated image on the computer, the emotion comes and goes, just as the light only lasts for a second and never comes back. For me, this series is neither photography nor painting. It's a kind of new form.\n\nArtwork Title: Inwardness #332165\nDate of Artwork: 2021\nDimension: 3840 pixel x 3840 pixel\nType of Work: Programmable Art (Photogram, Digital Painting, GANs Algorithm trained images)\nDate of Dataset: 2021\nEdition: Unique",

Defined with boundaries and all that. However when you tried to find the end of, the last floor for example, it was an effort in vain.

Watch for a few of the Wild Ozark critters to appear in this one: bobcat, deer, and bear. These are all critters that live here at Wild Ozark.\n\nAll of my NFT work begins with a real painting in handmade Ozark watercolor pigments. To make my paints, I gather, crush, and process rocks I find here in the creeks or on our land in northwest Arkansas USA. When I paint a Twisted Tree, I don't know how they will look until their personality reveals themselves to me. Each one is unique.\n\nI made modifications to the painting for this NFT by adding hand-drawn or photography elements. The leaves are hand-drawn and digitally edited. The animals began as photo captures from our game camera. Other differences from the real-life original, like the flowers and weather elements, for example, are done digitally.\n\n",

      "description": "AI x Klimt x Adele x Dreams\nby Hulki Okan Tabak\nminted on Async Art\n\n24 pieces 24 hours \n\n...\n\nThis work is based on Gustav Klimt's first portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer (1907). The piece has been sold by Christie's in a private for USD 135 million in 2006. The piece is in public domain. \n\nI have walked through various stages of re-imagination on the original piece. I have first applied a general conversion which was subsequently mixed with various genes from randomly selected digital works. I selectively defined starting points and increments that I followed for the next 23 images in journeying with Adele through genders and worlds. The process was awesome, fun and immersive. The end result is strange, post-modern and anything but plain beautiful. It speaks to my mind partly as a visual provocation but even more so as a vessel to convey how close sit different states and sides of life.\n\n...\n\nPortrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I (also called The Lady in Gold or The Woman in Gold) is a painting by Gustav Klimt, completed between 1903 and 1907. The portrait was commissioned by the sitter's husband, Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer, a Jewish banker and sugar producer. The painting was stolen by the Nazis in 1941 and displayed at the Österreichische Galerie Belvedere. The portrait is the final and most fully representative work of Klimt's golden phase. It was the first of two depictions of Adele by Klimt—the second was completed in 1912; these were two of several works by the artist that the family owned. (Wikipedia)",

It's a real scene from a real barnyard in Weesatche, TX in a little German settlement that is now a ghost town. I used pics from my husband's photo album to recreate the scene. For this NFT I embellished it. A lot. I hope you enjoy it. I had a ton of fun creating it.",

      "name": "Street Photography, Japan - ストリートフォトグラフィー ",
      "description": "A series of 6 black and white street photos I took during my time in Japan (full descriptions below). \nThe idea was to use the 24 hours autonomous template with only 6 images which change every hour. This way wherever you are you'll be able to enjoy the full set of images. \nThe 6 photos are part of the series: \"WABI-SABI: Acceptance of transience... The Beauty of things that are Imperfect, Impermanent, Incomplete.\" \nThere are lots of details in these images. It is ideal to show this artwork on a large 4K screen. Please take the time to look at them on full screen. Thank you.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF PHOTOS:\n\n1. \"Wa\": Harmony. The harmonious heart of the Japanese value system | Reflections... Into The Depth Of Life.\nKYOTO - I was standing behind the man with the umbrella taking a picture of his reflection on the window while he was looking into the shop at the two women working. The idea was to create something like a double exposure but within a single shot. Many layers in this image. \n\n2. “Satori”: Enlightenment. \nTOKYO - To attain Satori a person must get rid of all their desires and enmities at the source... This monk in the middle of the busy streets of Tokyo was completely detached from the chaos of daily life.\n\n3. \"Reflect On Yourself, The Dance Of Man And God\"\nKAMAKURA - The idea was to show \"Man\" as the small entity he is in comparison to the greater powers at play such as nature/universe/energy. The little man seems to be dancing in front of his God, which in reality is just a reflection of what he does not fully understand.\nI took this photograph with certain elements in mind:\n- the small man is in direct contrast with the large reflection of the Buddha (to balance it out).\n- the part of the Buddha at the top is the one missing in the reflection.\n- The \"leading\" lines of the pavements have been used to direct the viewer's attention to the \"real\" subject... the little man. \n\n4. “Mono no Aware”: Pathos. Contemplating the Fleeting Beauty and elegance in action. \nYOKOHAMA - My objective was to freeze the moment yet retain some movement on the main subject (the hair of the woman, the dress, the shoe) to make the photo more dynamic and interesting. Also, the woman walking out of frame was part of the intention, so that it appears she is leaving (this is not a crop but the full image). Please note that there is no model in this image - it is just someone walking by.\nAll of these elements were combined to convey the idea of Fleeting Beauty and Elegance... no beauty will last forever, and the Sakura/Hanami itself is a symbol of the transience of beauty in Japanese culture.\n\n5. \"Setsu\": Transition. An important turning point in life.\nTOKYO - When I saw this couple leaving each other, I composed the shot using the phone boot to balance the white rectangle where the two people are standing.\n\n6. “Uchi to Soto:” Inside and outside social relationships. Who to share your feeling with.\nKYOTO - A street photography composition.",

      "description": "For the newest addition to my ICON series, I present to you Kate Moss. Kate has been at the forefront of fashion and art since the early 1990s. I wanted to pay homage to her timeless beauty in the form of a beautiful clock. \n\nEach of the 12 polaroids that comprise this mosaic is given a time slot of one hour. At midnight Kate is shown in deep blue, but as each hour passes, another polaroid will shift color, starting at the top left and going through the hours of the day from left to right. So when it is 4am, the first four polaroids will be lit up in color. At noon, when all of the polaroids have changed colors, the piece will begin to reverse and shift gradually back to deep blue, with the amount of blue polaroids now dictating the hour. I have signed the piece with my initials AM on the bottom right corner for the AM hours, and left it blank for PM. Like a clock, you will be able to see what hour of the day it is based on how many of the polaroids have shifted color. \n\nThe first owner of this NFT will also be gifted the 1/1 physical polaroid set used to create this digital clock. The piece will come framed in a sleek white frame measuring 20'' x 15'' and have a unique color combination not seen here on Async. It will be accompanied by a signed certificate of authenticity. \n",

She creates the works in the Chelsea streets & a roster of elaborate country estates. She, her crack team, and lookalikes are highly skilled at running from Police when they turn up unannounced for a photoshoot with ‘The Queen'.\n\n00:00 Breakfast in Bed with Corgis\nThe Queen wakes up every morning with her corgis, and breakfast.\n\n01:00 Putting on Stockings\nThe Queen never dresses herself.\n\n02:00 Feeding the Corgis\nAlways fed on a silver salver, never by a footman\n\n03:00 The Footman plays with Corgis\nThe Queen was a little tired this morning, so a footman had to take over\n\n04:00 The Queen on the Loo \nYou can’t imagine The Queen on the loo, but here she is! The location really disagreed to “The Queen”, so she snuck in...\n\n05:00 Diana gives the Finger\nI was so nervous when I made this! Studying at the Royal College of Art, shortly after Diana’s death, I wasn’t allowed to make any work about Princess Diana! The ‘Royal’ college didn’t want to become the ‘College of Art’. It’s Diana saying ‘F*** You’ to the media for chasing her.\n\n06:00 Walking with Camilla\nI always wonder what they discuss\n\n07:00 The Queen watches her Horses Mate\nThis was shot at a friend’s stud. My photo assistant and I were so shocked at the first ‘go’, no one took any pictures! We had to wait 30 mins for the stud horse to reload...\n\n08:00 The Queen and Camilla Drink \nI think Camilla needs a stiff drink\n\n09:00 Looking at Cards\nThe Queen is the most popular celebrity in the world.\n\n10:00 Catching the Bus\nOne likes to do normal things\n\n11:00 At William Hill\nThe Queen can't resist racing! Here she is getting in a quick bet in\n\n12:00 The Queen, Camilla and Kate at the Hair Salon \nOf course, The Queen has to keep her hair absolutely set\n\n13:00 The Queen Shops at Tesco \nThis was shot ‘guerrilla style’ I just turned up with ‘The Queen’ and my whole crew. Shot on Curzon Street, London\n\n14:00 The Queen’s Selfie with Kim Kardashian \nI had to create a brand new wig for this, which cost around £10’000 to create\n\n15:00 The Queen with Sir Elton John\nThe real Sir Elton John, shot in his home in Las Vegas. He sang Dancing Queen and they danced together in his ballroom\n\n16:00 Blowing out her Candles\nThis cake had to be 1/2m wide in order to fit all 95 candles on it\n\n17:00 Sunbathing in a Deckchair \nRelaxing at one of the most beautiful castles in England, Belvoir Castle\n\n18:00 Royal selfie\nThis was a nightmare shoot. None of my lookalikes actually look like the real person, it’s all about getting them in the right position. But as soon as one person was set up, the next had moved\n\n19:00 The Family receive Gifts \nPDA from Harry and Meghan, and William and Kate representing the institution, as usual. Shot at The Director’s Institute \n\n20:00 Celebrating with Champagne\nWe opened 5 bottles of Champagne: it felt exactly like Christmas, despite shooting in summer\n\n21:00 The Royal Family watches Oprah\nI envisaged a shocked scene whilst  ‘The Firm’ watched Oprah’s interview. My Oprah lookalike is a dead ringer.\n\n22:00 Queen with Marigolds\nThis is my response to the public-fantasies around The Queen\n\n23:00 The Queen Sleeping in Regalia \nThe Queen is one of the busiest women in the world. She completes nearly 400 engagements a year, and she’s got to carry that Crown",

You're surrounded by your supporting cast: friends and family hanging in your immediate orbit.\n\nScattered a little further out, a network of acquaintances who drift in and out of contact over the years.\n\nBut there in the background, faint and out of focus, are the extras. The random passersby. Each living a life as vivid and complex as your own.\n\nThey carry on invisibly around you, bearing the accumulated weight of their own ambitions, friends, routines, mistakes, worries, triumphs and inherited craziness.\n\nWhen your life moves on to the next scene, theirs flickers in place, wrapped in a cloud of backstory and inside jokes and characters strung together with countless other stories you'll never be able to see. That you'll never know exists.\n\nIn which you might appear only once. As an extra sipping coffee in the background. As a blur of traffic passing on the highway. As a lighted window at dusk.”\n\n― The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows - John Koenig",

This is in fact true in our social lives too - we feel like time is too slow when we’re in certain circumstances while it’s too fast in others - our emotional position is the measure of time in this case. \n\nThe shadow clock is a symbolic representation of the premise of how mere positions in space of various elements of life represents time.",

      "description": "In the 1980s, string theory was proposed to be the sought-for unified theory that unifies all forces and matter. The strings are unable to be detected with current scientific methods. It's theorized that there are mini dimensions that are undetectable to us, and the strings are just as small so that they can vibrate through these dimensions connecting all forces and matter. \n\nIn this artwork, an individual discovers how to see and interact with these strings. He is able to navigate the strings as if they are a path on the ground. While traversing the paths through dimensions, he saw and experienced such otherwordly sensations and emotions. Experiences that are so alien to one's sense of reality that they can not be explained justly. \n\nTears run down his face as he is overcome by such never-before-seen beauty and by the realization that he is lost with no way back to his home dimension. What first felt like a dream quickly became a nightmare. He is constantly traversing the dimensional paths, running into the other versions of himself. However, his other selves aren't the same as him - they feel as though they are imposters, dangerous ones at that. His other selves feel the same way toward him.\n\nIs he doomed to wander the paths in fear for eternity? Will he eventually find a way out? The answer is unknown.",

      "description": "THE WORK INCLUDES LAYERS WITH A TOTAL OF 4 DIFFERENT WING EDITIONS IN IT WHICH CAN BE COMPARED TO MULTIPLE RESULTS. THE BODY PART WAS CREATED BY A GENERATIVE 3D DESIGN WITH THE ARTIST'S DEBUGGING. THE ARTIST, CHEN ZENG, TRIES TO BRING NEW GENERATIVE TECHS INTO CLASSIC FIGURES, CREATES BRAND NEW VIRTUAL EXPLORATION.\n斯芬克斯最初源于古埃及的神话，是长有翅膀的怪物，通常为雄性，当时的传说中有三种斯芬克斯——人面狮身的Androsphinx、羊头狮身的Criosphinx、鹰头狮身的Hieracosphinx。亚述人和波斯人则把斯芬克斯描述为一只长有翅膀的公牛，长着人面、络腮胡子，戴有皇冠。多种形态的变化是艺术家选取司芬克斯作为图层拆解的出发点。\n在希腊神话中，赫拉派斯芬克斯坐在忒拜城附近的悬崖上，拦住过往的路人，用缪斯所传授的谜语问他们，猜不中者就会被它吃掉，这个谜语是：“什么动物早晨用四条腿走路，中午用两条腿走路，晚上用三条腿走路？”俄狄浦斯猜中了正确答案，谜底是“人”。斯芬克斯的人面象征着智慧和知识。一说斯芬克斯之谜在更深层次的表现为“恐惧和诱惑”，即“现实生活”。在艺术家看来，司芬克斯同样在帮助人理解人本身。艺术家的系列雕塑作品都使用人工智能参与造型生成，本次nft作品中分开的身体元件来自于不同参数下程序给出的结果，艺术家认为，研究人工智能生成逻辑的过程同样是一个尝试理解人本身，理解创造力的过程。\n\n\nThe sphinx originated from ancient Egyptian mythology. It was a winged monster, usually male. There were three types of sphinx in the legend at that time - the Androsphinx with the human face and lion body, the Criosphinx with the head of the sheep, Hieracosphinx with eagle head. Assyrians and Persians describe the Sphinx as a winged bull with a human face, beard and crown. The variety of forms is the starting point for the artist to choose Sphinx as the layer dismantling.\n\nIn Greek mythology, the Sphinx sat on a cliff near the city of Thebes, stopped passers-by, and asked them with a riddle taught by the Muses, and those who could not guess right would be eaten. This riddle is: \"What animal walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs at night?\" Oedipus guessed right. The correct answer is \"human\". The human face of the sphinx symbolizes wisdom and knowledge. It is said that the mystery of the Sphinx is expressed in a deeper level as \"fear and temptation\", that is, \"real life\". From the artist's point of view, the Sphinx is also helping people understand people themselves. The artist's series of sculpture works all use artificial intelligence to participate in modeling generation. The separate body elements in this nft work come from the results given by the program under different parameters. The artist believes that the process of studying artificial intelligence generation logic is also an attempt to understand people themselves. , to understand the process of creativity.",

      "description": "A 'Money Tree', or Pachira Aquatica is said to bring good financial fortune and positive 'chi', or energy, into a home.\nI'm interested in plants and organic structures, here from an artistic perspective and as a means of (abstract) expression in various media including photographic art, also to confront both a seasonal (winter) and social (covid/omicron) mood.\nWe still have so much to learn from plants: architecturally, spiritually, scientifically... \nA main objective is simply to take the viewer closer or 'inside' the houseplant over 24 hours and to explore and appreciate its details via unusual perspectives, perhaps finding inspiration in the organic design. The 24 individually-enhanced, selected images are not tied to the hours from any single day but have been chosen to follow a loose progression; my own adventure or preoccupation. You could say this Money Tree is a reflection of its unique growth and my small mission to find out (or 'see') the details of this growth. Why do we strive to explore and enhance Nature? Perhaps we want to make it more attractive than it is, to increase its appeal, and energy, and to impress the passive viewer (within) somehow through our diverse bids for control and freedom? The result: this new form of 'super' Money Tree as a dynamic NFT. The  process of art can be as obsessive as studying money markets, or finding global cures for viruses, and it's a question which relates to an ongoing series titled  'Organic Metaverse'. It aims to explore our need for being lost in the natural world, already present, right before our eyes, and where 'a fool sees not the same tree that a wise man sees.' (Blake). Most of art is a safe form of exploring, so let's set out again, and possibly reveal more of the less familiar and hidden things, or just find sanctuary there.\n\nade mc\n2022",

      "description": "This project began as a tactile, mixed media collage series using the simple, geometric, heart shape, a symbol of love and joy and used quite heavily as an emoji these days. These works were created to manifest and channel love into this physical world directly from the source of all that is through the creative process, using found paper and reinterpreted digitally through the use of clipping masks and vector graphics and yet again through blockchain technology and generative art processes. Some of the found paper for these works include; shopping bags, 1970's toy catalogs, food packaging, kids' activity books, newspaper and magazine pages, and more.\n\nMr.Brian Design has been using found paper and tactile materials as a rendering technique in his mixed media portraiture for several years and has exhibited those works throughout Japan. This series is a paired down result of those efforts in pure form.\n\nMr.Brian Design's Mixed Media Portraiture may be viewed here: https://mrbd-at-good-neighbors-gallery.tumblr.com/",

A self-exploration of the feminine form; an introspective odyssey upon the digital seas only touching briefly the sensual shores of the real world.

The luxury of safe self-expression is elusive; only further complicated by age, color, creed, sex, gender, ability, sexuality, and class. Whether it be in real or digital spaces, feminine bodies are treated with a spectrum of toxic hostile reactions from self-appointed patriarchal enforcers who take it upon themselves to steal joy, love, life, and happiness from any female (sex or gendered) persons that exercise their self-sovereignty in public or private; real or digital spaces. Despite the culture of terror, the feminine aspect of humanity is asserting herself and sisters are embodying in their power.\n\nINQUIRY: \n\nWhen the last grain of dust settles on the digital frontier what will the real world look and feel like? Will NFB’s (non-fungible-beings) and their fleshy forms be treasured or despised? Will the real world lay in rubble?

      "description": "SPINAL is a piece I originally created during the summer of 2021. It was born not unlike any of my other creations. After a long day at work and getting the kids tucked in for the night, I sat down at my desk, put on the headphones, and got to work. If I recall correctly, there was a mix of Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, and Pearl Jam streaming from the playlist that night. And, as usually happens, a couple of hours later, the piece was complete. I'm honestly not sure what happens during that time, I just let the music lead the way and eventually push the shapes and colors into a form that speaks to me. There's something about the symmetry and the mix of hard and soft lines in this one that give it a great mood I think.\n\nFor this updated version of SPINAL, I chose to bring the artwork to life on Async and reveal the power of adding and removing the various layers to create 24 unique versions of the artwork that update every hour of the day.

Basquiat is indeed a source of inspiration and great influence in our work prior to our collaboration and reflects in our artworks.  Enjoy the piece",

I experimented with the results with additions, my photographs and some iterations to arrive at these images. The final edit in Photoshop was only for sizing and minor contrast curve adjustment.

I have explored the relationship between the light in photography and the line in painting since 2020. Photography retains the interpretation of the light, and the line could be one of the forms to present the light. I created photograms with the shape of the light in the darkroom, then trained them to generate brand-new integrated images. After that, I painted and destroyed the image with lines, colors, and recomposed the image. The materials in this series includes Photograms (Cameraless photographic processes), Digital Paintings, and AI-generated images (Gans Algorithm). The dataset of AI-generated images contains 300 photograms and 300 digital paintings.\n\n\nArtwork Title: Inwardness #700791\nDate of Artwork: 2022\nDimension: 2160 pixel x 2160 pixel\nType of Work: Programmable Art (Photogram, Digital Painting, GANs Algorithm trained image)\nDate of Dataset: 2021\nEdition: Unique",

      "description": "In The Real Imaginary Verse, contemplating flowers made of fractals of time and space. \nYou can feel the quantum energy popping here and there during the early seasons. A bit similar to our pollen during spring in our universe I guess. \nDepth of Infinity makes these beautifully changing over nuances of lights during a full cycle. Absolutely stunning in person... \nTime is relative and flexible, and the dividing line between past, present, and future is an illusion. Reality is ultimately timeless. These quantum flowers are the reflection of that magical delight of pure energy with no time nor space boundaries. \n\n\"There is no branch of mathematics, however abstract, which may not some day be applied to phenomena of the real world.\" ― Nikolai Lobachevsky",

A desire to be included, wanted.\nAnger, bitterness. A feeling of unworthiness. Daydreaming about inclusion.\nMay escalate to: SADNESS, HURT, DEPRESSION, RESIGNATION.\n\nDEPRESSION: A state of withdrawal; extreme sadness and reduced vitality.\nMental response: Focusing inward. Desiring to live in the past or be alone. Poor observation skills. Obsessive thoughts. A negative outlook. Losing track of time. An inability to concentrate.\nMay relate to: NOSTALGIA, REGRET, SADNESS, LONELINESS.\n\nWe struggle to talk about our emotions and our mental health.

      "description": "This piece is part of a mental health awareness campaign called Think Pink, designed to help people spot, relate and understand the emotions they are feeling. Each piece of artwork is a representation of what the mind could project if one was experiencing that said emotion.\n\nWhen it is daytime, this piece represents Guilt. When the sun sets and the moon rises, its state will change to Remorse.\n\nGUILT: A feeling of culpability over an offence (either real or imagined).\nMental response: Replaying what happened. Anxiety. Thoughts filled with self-loathing. Desiring to confess or share the pain or burden with another. Brooding, retreating inward, withdrawing from others.\nMay escalate to: CONFLICTED, REGRET, SHAME, REMORSE\n\nREMORSE: Distress resulting from guilt over wrongdoing; a desire to undo\nMental response: Mentally berating oneself over an action or poor decision. Wanting to face consequences. Empathy for other parties and what they are going through. Obsessing over finding a way to repay the debt.\nMay escalate to: SHAME, REGRET, DETERMINATION.\n\nWe struggle to talk about our emotions and our mental health. Through art and NFTs people and communities can come together to recognise and speak openly about their mental state.\n\nEmotions are nothing to be ashamed of. We all have them.\n\nWelcome to the movement that is... Think Pink.",

      "description": "What the “Modern” human describes as the “primitive” human, has long used or re-used places that are suitable for living without leaving for thousands of years, which has resulted in multi-layered hill like structures which we call “mounds”. Mounds are the usage of living spaces that are constructed from the ashes of what has been destroyed by wars or natural causes, a rebirth.\n\nIt is possible to examine the distant past through archeological methods. But how can we examine the current moment we live in and the process of these “modern mounds”?\n\nThroughout history and today, we see these layered structures rapidly moving towards both the sky and the undergrounds while transforming, breaking, accumulating, and mixing. In this context, the project works to strip away from the real plane, and move towards the plane of an image while creating a new space that offers contemplation through the examination of overtime. Also the project challenges the concept of “a moment” while examining a long stretch of time and works to keep an up to date record of these modern mounds.",

Far away from the hustle-bustle of our city life which is full of machines, here we see the beauty of the nature in various shades. With advancement in technology, we look at out mobile phones or our watches to know the time, but a farmer who has sown seeds and seen the soil enriched with cultivation, knows the time of the day just by looking at the sun/moon rays falling on it. He does not need any watch or a mobile phone to know if its noon or evening. The same flower can look differently and in a different colour throughout the day, just like humans who can be vibrant  irrespective of time - be it a warmer day, a sunny noon, a breezy evening or a chilled night.\n\nFlorality is a unique 1/1 artwork based on 24-Hour time cycle comprising 24 images that change one image per hour (Pacific Time). The art created using javaprocessing & simulated based on day & night time cycles using neural machine learning algorithms.\n\nTechnical specifications ->\nDimensions - 3000 x 3000\nTotal Images - 24\nAverage size per image - 11.08 MB\nTotal file size of 24 images - 266 MB\nEdition - Unique (1/1)",

The fact that this \"conversation with God\" has hardly ever been depicted (in contrast to the Passion) is probably due to the immense message it conveys. The fact that the painter Mathias Rusch dared to translate the \"Our Father\" can be explained by the fact that his daily work was based on faith, hope and trust in God. Mathias Rusch was aware that he could only exist in the understanding of his art \"as a gift of God\". Most of his late works (Our Father, Live and Let Live, Sermon on the Mount, Lauretan Litany, Litany of the Sacred Heart) were written, as he confessed, under the \"kind help\" of the Highest, always accompanied by personal prayers, meditations or invocations. The fact that Mathias Rusch did not reveal a dying word for the interpretation of his works of art is to be justified by the fact that he understood himself to a large extent as a mediator of a higher power. Thus we are sometimes quite helplessly confronted with an immense abundance of Christian symbols, metaphysical allusions, concretizations and abstractions, in unique hues and compositions. Completely in the sense of Mathias Rusch we dive before the 13 works of art into the enormous topic of earthly existence and Christian eschatology, marvel before the color power, before the hints, confessions and convictions of the very deeply felt \"Our Father's\".

Packed into a few sentences, it has come to be regarded as the actual confession of faith and is prayed millions of times a day, both individually and in communities. The fact that this \"conversation with God\" has hardly ever been depicted (in contrast to the Passion) is probably due to the immense message it conveys. The fact that the painter Mathias Rusch dared to translate the \"Our Father\" can be explained by the fact that his daily work was based on faith, hope, and trust in God. Mathias Rusch was aware that he could only exist in the understanding of his art \"as a gift of God\". Most of his late works (Our Father, Live and Let Live, Sermon on the Mount, Lauretan Litany, Litany of the Sacred Heart) were written, as he confessed, under the \"kind help\" of the Highest, always accompanied by personal prayers, meditations or invocations. The fact that Mathias Rusch did not reveal a word for the interpretation of his works of art is to be justified by the fact that he understood himself to a large extent as a mediator of a higher power. Thus we are sometimes quite helplessly confronted with an immense abundance of Christian symbols, metaphysical allusions, concretizations, and abstractions, in unique hues and compositions. Completely in the sense of Mathias Rusch we dive before the 13 works of art into the enormous topic of earthly existence and Christian eschatology, marvel before the color power, before the hints, confessions, and convictions of the very deeply felt \"Our Father's\". Finally, we become humbled and ultimately grateful to be initiated into the world-prayer of a \"knowing\" believer, again and again, with each glance at each of these magnificent works of art. Whoever takes a longer \"eye\" look at this self-contained, unique complete work, consisting of 13 unique pieces in oil on canvas, 170x170cm, will not be able to resist a lasting effect and deep consternation.",

Seeing celebrities live in this world of excessive media coverage, I started to develop a mixed feeling of admiration and respect, but also pity, and finally detachment. \n\nThe Personalities are decomposed and re-assembled in an abstract composition, guided by my instinct and fed by what the model inspired in me.\n\nThe original digital size of \"Cybèle\" portrait is 120 by 180 cm. \n\nThis is a portrait of the artist Solange Knowles.",

The dataset from this series includes 300 photograms I made in the darkroom and 300 digital paintings I drew.\n\nThe concept of Relativity dearly changes my way of seeing and creating. When I hold light source on the Black & White photographic enlarging paper in the darkroom, I come over a sort of illusion that I am drawing. Even though I know that I'm making photographs because each beam of light represents its time and space. Painting is the outlet for my feelings. When I am drawing on the AI-generated image on the computer, the emotion comes and goes, just as the light only lasts for a second and never comes back. For me, this series is neither photography nor painting. It's a kind of new form.\n\n\nArtwork Title: Inwardness #231260\nDate of Artwork: 2022\nDimension: 3840 pixel x 3840 pixel\nType of Work: Programmable Art (Photogram, Digital Painting, GANs Algorithm trained images)\nDate of Dataset: 2021\nEdition: Unique",

      "description": "In a random part of the universe where the stars shine bright, there is a place in which people come together and wait for a signal, to open and close some boxes. The meaning behind this phenomenon is still unknown.\n\nSUMMARY\nSome Boxes is a social experiment about art ownership. The goal requires collectors to open and close their boxes when signaled to do so. Any collector that fails to comply with the rules will result in their box being permanently sealed with tape, removing that collectors ability to open or close their box forever.\n\nBOX(CONTROL)\nThis layer is the box at the top of the artwork. It’s used to signal Box(1) through to Box(20), when it's time to open or close their respective boxes. There are only 2 rules:\n- If Box(Control) is open, collectors must open their box. \n- If Box(Control) is closed, collectors must close their box. \nAll collectors will have 48 hours from the transaction timestamps of any Box(Control) changes, to comply with these rules. The frequency of when Box(Control) opens or closes is currently unknown. Box(Control) cannot be purchased. \n\nBOXES\nThere are twenty boxes from Box(1) through to Box(20). Boxes can be opened or closed by their layer owners. The decision to open or close a box is decided by the owners, but signaled by Box(Control).\n\nTAPE\nThere are twenty tapes from Tape(1) through to Tape(20). Tape is used to permanently seal boxes when they fail to comply with any rules.\nThere are four colors of tape: brown, white, black and gold. The color of tape used to seal a box will depend on how many other boxes were sealed before it.\nOnce tape has been used to seal a box, that tape layer will be burnt, causing those boxes to be sealed forever. Tape layers cannot be purchased. \n\nFor a more comprehensive guide and better understand of Some Boxes, please visit: https://www.bottlesartwork.com/someboxes",

Many of us have discovered new friends on the far side of the world, distance many will never traverse, physically, but that is digitally just seconds away. We build these relationships in a digital world. Not unlike the physical world, we also need to learn to cope with this digital distance. \n\nThis work is based on the series \"Distance\", Monotype prints in ink on paper. As an active member of the NFT community, I've discovered the many parallels between the physical and digital distances that impact our relationships; for better and worse. Not only are territorial distances that impact time zones but also cultural, generational and gender distances that must be carefully and thoughtfully navigated. Each of these have kept us separate from each other at times, everyone retreating to a safe distance, due to lack of mutual understanding. Here in the NFT space we've learned from each other's individual experiences, appreciating and inspiring everyone and inevitably reducing the distance between us. \n\nThat's how we are building a strong community and a better future.",

      "description": "“Untitled #3” is part of the series of 3D stereographic photo collages “Slits in Depth”, by Pedro Victor Brandão, that since 2020 is being minted on async.art as dynamic compositions that alternate interior and exterior spaces in impossible perspectives, leveraged by the programmable features of the platform.\n\nCreated in the third pandemic year, this work was commissioned by Pivô for the exhibition \"Guided tour\", curated by the curatorial platform aarea (founded by Livia Benedetti and Marcela Vieira). \"Guided tour'' is the edition #4 of Pivô Satélite program. In addition to Pedro Victor Brandão, artists Gabriel Junqueira, Júlia Rocha and Gabriel Massan also participate in the project. The artists were invited to create correspondences between Pivô's digital space and its exhibition space in the Copan Building, located in São Paulo.\n\nThe composition “Untitled #3” is made up of a frontal element together with two other images: an Adiantum twig photographed in front of a mirror; and two backgrounds: a cloudy sky and an interior environment of one of Pivô's galleries. During the 24 hours of the day, one background is gradually replaced by another. When viewed with red and cyan anaglyph glasses (red lens on the left eye), elements pop off the screen.\n\nDuring the exhibition period of the work on Pivô's website (March 23rd to April 24th, 2022), visitors can sign a document with their non-custodial wallet to enter the giveaway of the work.\n\nPivô Satélite can be accessed at https://www.pivo.org.br/en/satellite/\n________________________________________________\n\n“Sem Título #3” faz parte da série de fotocolagens estereográficas 3D “Cortes em Profundidade\", de Pedro Victor Brandão, que desde 2020 tem sido emitida no async.art como composições dinâmicas que alternam espaços interiores e exteriores em perspectivas impossíveis a partir das funcionalidades programáveis da plataforma. \n\nCriado já no terceiro ano pandêmico, este trabalho foi comissionado pelo Pivô para a exposição \"Visita guiada\", curada pela plataforma curatorial aarea (fundada por Livia Benedetti e Marcela Vieira). \"Visita guiada\" é a edição #4 do programa Pivô Satélite. Além de Pedro Victor Brandão, participam também do projeto xs artistas Gabriel Junqueira, Júlia Rocha e Gabriel Massan. Xs artistas foram convidadxs a criar correspondências entre o espaço digital do Pivô e seu espaço expositivo no Edifício Copan, localizado em São Paulo. \n\nA composição de “Sem Título #3” é feita de um elemento frontal junto a duas outras imagens: um galho de avenca fotografado em frente a um espelho; e dois fundos: um céu nebuloso e um ambiente interno de uma das galerias do Pivô. Durante as 24 horas do dia, um fundo é gradualmente substituído por outro. Quando vistos com um óculos anáglifo vermelho e ciano (lente vermelha no olho esquerdo), os elementos saltam da tela. \n\nDurante o período de exibição do trabalho no website do Pivô (23 de março a 24 de abril de 2022), visitantes podem assinar um documento com sua carteira não-custodial para concorrer ao sorteio do trabalho.\n\nPivô Satélite pode ser acessado em https://www.pivo.org.br/satelite/\n\nPedro Victor Brandão\nMAR 2022",

In this work she recreates and re-prototypes in 3D the Art lamps conceived in the 70s by her father designer, and produced in limited edition by the visionary Italian company New Lamp. A few very rare examples of these Art lamps / light sculptures, now out of production and almost all lost, have recently become collector's items in the modernism market, and sold for tens of thousands of dollars by Christie's and other major auction houses.\nThis project, animated by the artist’s desire to celebrate the genius of her father, digitally brings back to life a lost piece of Italian design from one of the most innovative and brilliant periods in recent history.\n\nRiflessa\nby Gianfranco Fini\nNew Lamp, 1970\n\nA luminous panel in stainless steel with white lacquered metal. The steel cubes are magnetic and can be interactively re-arranged to create infinite light patterns. This was originally a very large wall lamp, measuring 81 x 81 x 10 cm. The piece is featured in Luce lampade 1968-1973: il nuovo design italiano, Fulvio Ferrari e Napoleone Ferrari, Allemandi Editore.\n\nThe collector of this NFT will receive as a reward a hand-drawn sketch of the lamp signed by Gianfranco Fini.",

This NFT will speak out to the world and call on more allies.

After some time, it became the same scenes, the same clichés, the same smiles, the same looks and the same photographers. As a celebrity, having to see more than 30 flashes per second every time a photographer spots them, probably makes them want to protect themselves. Seeing celebrities live in this world of excessive media coverage, I started to develop a mixed feeling of admiration and respect, but also pity, and finally detachment.\n\nThe Personalities are decomposed and re-assembled in an abstract composition, guided by my instinct and fed by what the model inspired in me.\n\nThe original digital size of \"La fureteuse\" portrait is 180 by 120 cm. \n\nThis is a portrait of the entrepreneur, Angela Simmons. \nIf you set it on \"sunrise\", it will display the original photography.",

      "description": "Proof of Concept contains a small square that can move to 19,522 locations using only two layers.\n\nDynamic non-fungible tokens of our time are still very much in their infancy. We are plagued with high transaction fees, smothered in centralization and limited in our technology. Our blockchain is off-chain. Those who can code thrive, while those who cannot are banished, alongside the ideas they will never be able to create. There are glimmers of hope though. A few individuals and entities have began sharing tools amongst the less knowledgeable, providing years of experience within what feels like days. This is life changing for a lot of us.\n\nProof of Concept has dimensions of 1920x1080 pixels. The grid space is 1880x1040 pixels, with each individual grid representing 10x10 pixels in width and height. This leaves 188x104 grids that the square can move to, which equates to 19,522 individual locations. \n\nThe three layers available in this artwork are: X-Axis, Y-Axis and Color. The X-Axis controls the x position of the square, while the Y-Axis controls the y position of the square. The Color controls the color of the square. There are two colors to choose from: gold and black. Gold is slightly special as it behaves like a gradient, changing brightness depending on the x position of the square.\n\nIt's worth noting that with an additional 2708 states (1732+976) added to the X-Axis and Y-Axis layers of this artwork, all 2,073,600 locations could have been available for the square to move to (assuming each individual grid had a dimension of one pixel). This was purposely not included. A few of these locations would move the square off the artwork, minor x and y changes would be unnoticeable and individual grid spaces would be impossible to distinguish from one another. It's also worth noting that with an additional two layers, and 768 states, all 16,777,216 colors of the RGB Color Model could have been available to choose from for the square. This was purposely not included as well.\n\nProof of Concept was created to answer one simple question: \"Given the knowledge and tools available to me at this current time, can I move a square around an artwork without limitation on how many locations it can move to?\". \n\nThe concept has been proven. It is possible.",

After some time, it became the same scenes, the same clichés, the same smiles, the same looks and the same photographers. As a celebrity, having to see more than 30 flashes per second every time a photographer spots them, probably makes them want to protect themselves. Seeing celebrities live in this world of excessive media coverage, I started to develop a mixed feeling of admiration and respect, but also pity, and finally detachment.\n\nThe Personalities are decomposed and re-assembled in an abstract composition, guided by my instinct and fed by what the model inspired in me.\n\nThe original digital size of \"Corps malade\" portrait is 50 by 40 inch.\n\nThis is a portrait of the singer Nasir Jones aka \"NAS\". ¨\nIf you set it on \"sunrise\", it will display the original photography.",

Why do only one painting if you can do several, each in different colors?! this piece celebrates this approach because I think in art it is important to try and play. That's how you get to the really interesting things. \nHe was fascinated by advertising and celebrities & by the idea of people as brands or consumer products. What's happening now really reflects his vision. We are all consumer products in some way and we all have our 15 minutes of fame.",

Just like twins, they are shields of each other. \n\nLife tries to devalue us for the sake of testing us. However, fortunately, there is always someone who sees our true worth. At this point, what we have to do is to protect that love and to cherish it, just like the crown placed on our head, which we are obliged to carry. After all, what makes us who we are is the meaning of our lives. The meaning of life is this power that feeds us.\n\nWith my endless respect and love for all the effort he put into making me who I am...\n\nMitra",

      "description": "Conceived as a series with three volumes, the Newly Abridged Happiness Manuals are conceptual poems that explore the tension between time and mind, between what we tell ourselves and what our minds tell us. How to construct a sense of self when our senses are constantly under assault? Our minds jump from thought to thought–which thought should we act upon?\n\nLife happens inside our minds, and our emotional realities are underpinned by thought. To examine the dynamic of thought is to examine the scaffolding that sustains our outward-facing selves. This series does so with humor, compassion, and straightforward honesty.\n\nThe first volume focuses on the way we experience the present tense, at times mundane, at others philosophical. The second and third volumes will probe our notions of past and future, worn down as they become by the passage of time, hour by waking–or, even, sleeping–hour.\n\nThis series expands on Caballero's exploration of the cyclical storytelling potential of Async's 24 hour canvas. Collectors of the piece will also receive a minted GIF version of the poem in which the 24 frames/verses of the text change every few seconds. Do our thoughts change from hour to hour, second to second, day to day? Or are we forever reliving the same thoughts, and thus, the same day?\n\nDebuted at the Digital Francisco Carolinum in April 2022.",

A few very rare examples of these Art lamps / light sculptures, now out of production, have recently become collector's items in the modernism market, and sold for tens of thousands of dollars at Christie's and other major auction houses.\nThis project, animated by the artist’s desire to celebrate the genius of her father, digitally brings back to life a lost piece of Italian design from one of the most innovative and brilliant periods in recent history.\n\nLogos\nby Gianfranco Fini\nNew Lamp, 1971\n\n​This Art lamp was made of polymer semi-transparent parallelepipeds of various sizes, resting on a chromium-plated steel base measuring 30 x 30 cm. The base had a luminous inner side creating interesting optical effects. The piece is featured in Luce lampade 1968-1973: il nuovo design italiano, Fulvio Ferrari e Napoleone Ferrari, Allemandi Editore.\n\nThe collector of this NFT will receive as a reward a hand-drawn sketch of the lamp signed by Gianfranco Fini.",

The storefronts display many sides of what it could be. I let my eyes travel inside the juxtaposed layers of possibilities, and my curiosity takes over to find something familiar yet surprising. Once I find that I hide between the reflected and the real life. Life is daring yet fragile, wild yet vulnerable, puzzled yet simple, content yet melancholic, and always in between. \n\nThese photographs are part of my \"In Between\" series, taken in New York City the last winter. There are two images of the same scene taken from a different angles changing every hour.",

After some time, it became the same scenes, the same clichés, the same smiles, the same looks and the same photographers. As a celebrity, having to see more than 30 flashes per second every time a photographer spots them, probably makes them want to protect themselves. Seeing celebrities live in this world of excessive media coverage, I started to develop a mixed feeling of admiration and respect, but also pity, and finally detachment.\n\n\nThe Personalities are decomposed and re-assembled in an abstract composition, guided by my instinct and fed by what the model inspired in me.\n\n\nThe original digital size of \"Les plaisantes\" portrait is 120 by 180 cm.\n\n\nThis is a portrait of the actor Jesse Tyler Ferguson & the actress Anna Chlumsky. \nIf you set it on \"sunrise\", it will display the original photography.",

Released as part of my series: ONE - a contemplative journey into the unseen world around us.\n\nUsing a minimal amount of colors and a precise juxtaposition of shapes, each piece challenges the intricate ways in which the human eye perceives. The collection is inspired by the ephemeral and intangible moments of life: unspoken words and feelings that can't be encapsulated in a singular understanding.\n\nRather than replacing parts of the art, Subtractive Reality invites layer owners to collaborate and subtract layers from the piece itself, creating new and vibrant optical illusions. Any changes to the original piece will also be influenced by the previously inexistent background and controller, resulting in thousands of possible outcomes.\n\nanthonyesebag.com",

After some time, it became the same scenes, the same clichés, the same smiles, the same looks and the same photographers. As a celebrity, having to see more than 30 flashes per second every time a photographer spots them, probably makes them want to protect themselves. Seeing celebrities live in this world of excessive media coverage, I started to develop a mixed feeling of admiration and respect, but also pity, and finally detachment.\n\n\nThe Personalities are decomposed and re-assembled in an abstract composition, guided by my instinct and fed by what the model inspired in me.\n\n\nThe original digital size of the portrait is 80 by 160 cm.\n\n\nThis is a portrait of the American model, Alexandra Richards.\nIf you set it on \"sunrise\", it will display the original photography.",

It has a particularly rich and complex texture. Its rendering is of a monochromatic gray while it is composed of a multitude of saturated colors. It looks like waves emanating from a very distant center or converging in an abyss.\nSunset set evokes the complexity of the fluids that continuously interact around us.

      "description": "Newly Abridged Happiness Manual, Vol I is a conceptual poem that explores the tension between time and mind, between what we tell ourselves and what our minds tell us. How to construct a sense of self when our senses are constantly under assault?\n\nThis work expands on Caballero’s exploration of the storytelling potential of Async’s 24 hour canvas. The collector of the piece will also receive an airdropped video version of the poem in which the 24 frames/verses of the text change every few seconds. \n\nDo our thoughts change from hour to hour, day to day? Or, are we trapped by the same thoughts, and, thus, essentially reliving a single day?\n\nDebuted at the Digital Francisco Carolinum in April 2022.\n\n--\n\nNewly Abridged Happiness Manual, Vol I\n\nwhat comes first\nthe word or the image\nin the kitchen the scent of thawed meat\nprefaces the raw sweat of noon\nwhere I reside it smolders\ndespite the promise of shade\nI resolve it's senseless to worry\nthe pink muscle of mind\ndraws me nowhere closer \ntomorrow\ncharts an unreal circle\nwhy must I choose\nbetween language or bread\nthe moral of the story is to want less\npanoramic thoughts\nlike everything that eats time\nif habitual will inhabit my day\nmeanwhile simple is not simplistic\nstrings stretched in separate ways\na wonderful day\nis conceived\nproduced like chilled fruit\nthe moral of the story is to want more\nevery waking hour",

Mixture of live footage, animations, drawings, and all sorts of eccentricities. \nFormat: MOV\nFile Size: 9.06 GB\nDimensions: 3840x2160\nLength: 23:07\n\n-\nUpon purchase I'll send the physical in the mail!\nContact me upon purchase and we'll get it setup!\nThe songs & video I will send via email/cloud storage!\n-\n\nLittle about the piece:\nI started working on the album cover after I created a couple songs that would eventually turn into the first tracks of The Wake. It was a lot of fun putting together the songs then listening to the latest mix while working on the drawing. I'd take mental notes of what I wanted to change so when I would hit a wall with the drawing I'd switch to music. Going in I knew that I wanted to have a casket, some trees, water, use only a couple of colors, and for the first time draw something larger than a piece of paper! The album I made before The Wake is called Death and I wanted this to be a sendoff of sorts so that train of thought led me to create a type of portal where the casket was heading. The vines kind of just happened and the water I wanted to have this unnatural swirliness to them. The part that took the longest was all the lines in the trees but it was sort of peaceful drawing all of them! \n\nOn average I tend to release an album every 2 years and I thought this was a perfect halfway point before I start working on my next music project to release somewhat of an *ABSOLUTE EDITION* of The Wake. I can't think of a better way to enjoy the album.",

      "name": "Newly Abridged Happiness Manual, Vol I",
      "description": "Newly Abridged Happiness Manual, Vol I is a conceptual poem that explores the tension between time and mind, between what we tell ourselves and what our thoughts tell us. \n\nOur emotional states are underpinned by the unspoken words that traverse our minds as thought. To examine these words is to examine the intimate scaffolding that sustains our outward-facing selves. This poem does so with humor, compassion, and straightforward honesty, highlighting both the mundane and contradictory nature of thought. \n\nConsisting of twenty-four short verses, each of which is displayed independently on a frame for sixty minutes, this piece takes advantage of Async Art’s 24hour canvas to explore the evolution–or lack thereof–of thought along the vast axis of time. Sloganeering statements of self-improvement and assertive grasps for the transcendental interrupt expressions of routine, of place, of physicality. In one breath, we conceive of an ideal tomorrow, in the next we abruptly reach for a peach. How to construct a meaningful sense of self when our senses are constantly under assault?\n\nThis artwork functions as a diptych–its collector will receive an airdropped video version in which the same twenty-four frames rotate in under a minute. The slow and fast versions of the poem work together to show how our thoughts cycle and recycle from second to second, hour to hour, moment to moment. \n\nBy rethinking the same thoughts, are we essentially reliving a single day?\n\nDebuted at the Digital Francisco Carolinum in April 2022.\n\n--\n\nNewly Abridged Happiness Manual, Vol I\n\nwhat comes first \nthe word or the image \nin the kitchen the scent of thawed meat \nprefaces the raw sweat of noon \nwhere I reside it smolders \ndespite the promise of shade \nI resolve it's senseless to worry \nthe pink muscle of mind \ndraws me nowhere closer \ntomorrow \ncharts an unreal circle \nwhy must I choose \nbetween language or bread \nthe moral of the story is to want less \npanoramic thoughts \nlike everything that eats time \nif habitual inhabit my day \nthough simple and simplistic \nwrench me with separate strings \na wonderful day \nis conceived \nproduced like chilled fruit \nthe moral of the story is to want more \nevery waking hour",

There was no cure from them, but there was a way to appease them and to eventually avoid their plagues.

They are created from souls of drowned people, especially ones that didn't meet funerary rites. Some people believed that Vodenjak is soul of very evil human that is punished by Gods to live in water. It is represented as human with long claws and tail, covered in moss or grass, or as old man with green beard and hair or as fish covered in mud. During day, he rests in decorated lair, while at night he pulls down unlucky people down into water, especially married men, so they can steal their women and make them into servants. He often damages watermills, bridges and fishing nets. People appeased Vodenjak by throwing rooster, chicken or sheep. Sometimes, people sacrificed and well-fed horse by throwing into water with stone tied to their neck.\n\nhttps://mythus.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Slavic_creatures#Vodenjak",

Which caused a horrid smell. No one could do a thing about it. Not kings. Not emperors. Not queens. Not even skilled marksmen. Until one day a sorcerer arrived. He was on the edge of this world—almost passing into the next. He hadn’t wanted to travel through Turris Vallis, but there was no other option. While he lodged in the city he became infuriated with the birds. So, he cursed them and the city they flew around. As he uttered the magic words he breathed his last and passed into the next dimension. And the birds got sucked into the turret roofs, where they were doomed to squawk and squabble for the rest of eternity. You may think the city traded one terrible thing for another. But this was not entirely true. The sorcerer gave the city reprise at night. The birds would disappear. And be followed by an unearthly silence that allowed the townsfolk peaceful sleep and pleasant dreams.\n\nThis NFT changes how it looks based on the time of day.

I wonder who else has such thoughts. Who else is wondering if they will ever make it in this life?\nI paint my most recent feelings in this piece, hoping others will be able to relate and maybe draw strength from the realization that they are not alone.\n'Soliloquy' is the story of a black man who is deep in thoughts about his life.\n\nThis piece began as a photograph of my street. Then photographs of Adire which is symbolic and crucial to representing my culture in my artworks. Next, I paint the stars and the male figure in my usual workflow, thereby creating a balance between the painted foreground and the photographed background.",

I wonder; how come the majority of humankind didn't insist to worship the Sun?\nI mean not only us, all life depends on Sun light but remember those moments when you watched sunset, those awe moments. It's something else right?... \n\nI took lots of sunset photographs in so many different locations for years.\nMost of the times I was not alone in those places. And I was fortuned enough to see different people from different lives come together without any judgement, in a peaceful and welcoming mood.\n\nWe inhabit this planet with billions of unique minds. Some anxious, some cool, some curious, some fool...\nIt's possible to see our fingerprints in almost all the good and bad things. We are ruling this. No doubt. We covered such distance since the beginning of our evolution. Congrats to us but somehow we still can't leave some of our stupid bad habits. \nNot a coincidence though, we are fighting each other since beginning. Such a dumb thing but we can't get over it. \n\nThe peaceful, awesome mood of sunsets and silhouette technique helped me to visualize human as a species without sub-characteristics to create this fine art photography collection. We are 'one' kind with many shades. \n\n\n''We came from the oceans...\nFor the sake of the sunlight..''",

Every student carries enormous debts on their shoulders.\nUsually, this debt is invisible but with this artwork it is for the public to see and experience. \n\nSummary\nStudent debt is a major problem in many countries, such as the Netherlands. Due to these financial debts, we and many others have several problems, such as mental health, psychological complaints and disadvantages of applying for a mortgage. \n\nThe Student Debt Collector represents 25 art students with student debts. We want to make this major invincible problem visible with this NFT. We are almost graduated and ready for the next step. However, we start our career and work-life with a combined debt of € 737.163,10. \n\nFor more details, a comprehensive guide and a better understanding of The Student Debt Collector, please visit: https://thestudentdebtcollector.com/",

I was afraid, it was too sweet to be defeated. plus it was boring. If I had the chance to choose a defeat, I would prefer the action one. The defeat of monotony constantly slept. His presence was heavy. I was coming through a dark wrinkle, I thought I'd get used to it. It's like my movements are restricted. I was ashamed of my ears, I was afraid of my eyes. It was tiring to fight with reluctance. I was offended by some songs. some of them bore my pain and I was grateful. I was lost, my life was spent searching for the way. If I could just throw that weight off, I'd be relieved. I was trapped, finally caught up in that feeling. I was without reason. Besides, I was tired. I didn't know the diet that should be given to be happy. I remember when I was very cold. My thoughts had become a prisoner of wishes. The sense of freedom that was rising inside of me was slowly coming. I was expecting this too. My history was a friend of repetition. I couldn't break my mirror of sameness. If I broke one, then I would put another tick on the list. The list was full, I'm still sad.\n\nArtwork Details:\nPrintable 57x57cm.\n\nSoftwares Used:\nPhotoshop + Illustrator.",

Some call them demons, monsters and zombies while I would prefer more neutral terms but nonetheless here are some of the photographs I've taken of them which I release with full disclosure and their cooperation. The prospective collectors should acknowledge the existence of \"undead\" and some even more exotic characters might cause some alarm among the general population. Therefore viewer caution is warranted even though most of these peoples I met during the NFT Summit seemed to be of absolutely good character (not sure about some demonic entities that did not respond) and interested in art and its manifestation with the technologies branded aptly as NFT and what not.",

I will give you seven colors and you could cover your body with them. When my work is done, you will display all your colors in the sky. Men will admire you and fall in love with your beauty. They will love you because they will know that you herald the arrival of the sun.”\nAnd so it was that from then on, the lord of the seven colors began to act in the sky, announcing the end of a storm and how men fell in love with him ever since.",

They include common dreams that all people share and a small part of dreams that make each person unique, just like that one percent of distinctive genes that make one an individual with unparalleled features.\n   A collector or a DAO led by their own mindset randomly combines and selects a sequence of images close to them and has a chance to create various mental DNA paragraphs referring to their own unique ideas and dreams.\n   Dreaming is a natural human condition. A human cannot live without dreaming. A true dream is very much like the horizon. Very often it is almost inaccessible, which does not make it less real though. That is why each of us always has an impetus to go on living and creating.\n\nDigital painting\n3840 x 2160 px",

Martinez at Ohio State University back in 2014.\n\nI have a particular interested in this as I have difficulty recognizing basic facial expressions (and emotions) due to ADHD and CPTSD so I found that creating these artworks, and especially using Ai to do so, is extremely interesting and I love the results.\n\nNot being able to regulate my own emotions sometimes means I can go through a lot of these emotions in a single day and being able to express myself through these artworks helps me get closer to understanding these emotions and myself.\n\nIts a life long journey and one I am happy to be taking (although it gets a bit rough sometimes, especially for my loved ones) and slowly figuring out (after 50 years on the planet) what makes me tick in the way I tick specifically.  \n\nDoing the work to learn about emotions and how to understand/regulate and enjoy them is allowing me to perhaps understand other people a bit better and also allows me to get closer to those I Love and Cherish and Ai has allowed me to achieve this with the greatest amount of pleasure.  This is singularly the most important benefit to me from working on myself.\n\nI almost have a synchronicity with the Ai as you can see in the images, some of them are quite clearly what they are supposed to be, others not so much, maybe just but not quite, that's pretty much me in a nutshell.\n\nAnyway I hope you enjoy the artworks, live a beautiful, soulful life, be compassionate and kind but most importantly love yourself for who you are, you are unique and worth Loving.\n\nMachatter",

      "description": "Don Quixote: Sketches - I by Hulki Okan Tabak, minted 1/1 on Async Art, 2022\n\n2 artworks in a daily cycle..\n\n...\n\nDon Quixote project is a highly personal interpretation of the hero and his world. Various photographic and AI tools are used to create, manipulate and recreate the images. The story will be numbered for all of us to track down what we hold essentially. Beyond ease of use, the numbers are not sequential. Each image is independent but some images will be interdependent parts of smaller stories which I will mention. I would also mint some editions outside of Manifold. Note that editions of this project could be 1/1s or multi editions. The mints on Async Art will not be numbered as they each contain multiple images in themselves.\n\n...\n\nDon Quixote is a Spanish epic novel by Miguel de Cervantes. Originally published in two parts, in 1605 and 1615, its full title is The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha.\n\nA founding work of Western literature, it is often labeled as the first modern novel and one of the greatest ever written. Don Quixote is also one of the most-translated books in the world.\n\nWhen first published, Don Quixote was usually interpreted as a comic novel. After the French Revolution, it was better known for its central ethic that individuals can be right while society is quite wrong and was seen as a story of disenchantment. In the 19th century, it was seen as social commentary, but no one could easily tell \"whose side Cervantes was on\". Many critics came to view the work as a tragedy in which Don Quixote's idealism and nobility are viewed by the post-chivalric world as insane, and are defeated and rendered useless by common reality. By the 20th century, the novel had come to occupy a canonical space as one of the foundations of modern literature and a formidable example of what letters can do. (wikipedia)",

Various photographic and AI tools are used to create, manipulate and recreate the images. The story will be numbered for all of us to track down what we hold essentially. Beyond ease of use, the numbers are not sequential. Each image is independent but some images will be interdependent parts of smaller stories which I will mention. I would also mint some editions outside of Manifold. Note that editions of this project could be 1/1s or multi editions. The mints on Async Art will not be numbered as they each contain multiple images in themselves.\n\n...\n\nDon Quixote is a Spanish epic novel by Miguel de Cervantes. Originally published in two parts, in 1605 and 1615, its full title is The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha.\n\nA founding work of Western literature, it is often labeled as the first modern novel and one of the greatest ever written. Don Quixote is also one of the most-translated books in the world.\n\nWhen first published, Don Quixote was usually interpreted as a comic novel. After the French Revolution, it was better known for its central ethic that individuals can be right while society is quite wrong and was seen as a story of disenchantment. In the 19th century, it was seen as social commentary, but no one could easily tell \"whose side Cervantes was on\". Many critics came to view the work as a tragedy in which Don Quixote's idealism and nobility are viewed by the post-chivalric world as insane, and are defeated and rendered useless by common reality. By the 20th century, the novel had come to occupy a canonical space as one of the foundations of modern literature and a formidable example of what letters can do. (wikipedia)",

While the celestial bodies moved, the tower absorbed the emanating cosmic energy. And as the birdlings flew nearby they would absorb that energy from the tower. In so doing, their feather colours would change in colour. Sometimes to white. Sometimes to green. Sometimes to sparkling gold.\n\nThis NFT changes how it looks based on the time of day.

      "description": "My earliest memory of an excavator is from our summer cabin with\nmy father is next to me as I am in the sandbox playing with a green metal toy excavator, which was just a mechanical digging arm with a seat on it. You would operate it by pushing and pulling on the handles you were holding on to. I remember the joy of discovering how it worked after the initial struggle, and how satisfying it was just to dig and move the sand around.\nMuch later in art school, I started doing ink drawing between painting sessions. I did a little bit of it in my teens when I was enthusiastic about making comics, though without much patience for it. And then, few years after my graduation I would pick the pens again, with more definite goals.\nI was often drawing just random things in my sketchbooks. I did not think much of them then. They were an excuse for the line as I wrote on a notebook once. I was trying to learn the medium. It was awkward first. I had wrong kind of paper, and the ink would splatter as the nibs scratched the paper. Then again, I cherished it and often abused my pens on purpose creating a big mess.\nLooking back, I see frustration of all kinds. I remember that my eyes got very tired quickly from drawing. I was not very good with expressing myself with words and especially dreaded writing, It is all in there.\nAt some point the excavators started to appear. I found them fascinating to look at, If saw one on a construction on my way to college. They reminded me of some ancient dinosaur, perhaps because of association from the Flintstones cartoon. I still stop to admire them sometimes. \nThe drawings were not trying to be actual representations of the machinery, though I did study them a little bit. The excavators were turning out to become a part of a system of symbols, same as with the repeating letter “a”, I was drawing with something of a built obsession as method to discover meaning with absurdity.\nThe idea began with the launch of the 24h feature on AsyncArt. It has changed a lot since, but it was always going to be something with excavators. \nSome of the watercolor works were made for this piece in particular. Though I forgot about them for a while until finding them in box stored away. Some are old ones all the way from my first exhibition. I put them all together and arranged them randomly. The runes I painted myself just for fun, let’s say, not intended to be used in art. As the time arose, I felt compelled to use them. I cast them randomly for each picture, as a symbolic gesture. The runes can be representing many things, from actual letters to wisdom and magic. There are many things we can see but don’t understand and then ignore until we learn their meaning, like words of a foreign language. \nThe old drawings from my sketchbooks were placed on the image transparently showing the inverted colors of what is below. I still feel ashamed about a lot of them, the silly puns and visual jokes, mundane scribbles, desires, and struggles contained within the pages, but it was necessary to the turn the ground for this work. Some of it I can appreciate more now and feel proud of things that I have made progress with.\nThis makes me think of history and archaeology. the act in time, digging in the present to gain knowledge of our past and creating it for the future, while we are constantly producing new material to be dug up later.\nThe feel for material is very important to me. whether digital or traditional, it takes time to get acquainted with it. With this piece my material is beyond the changing images and the technology making it possible - it is almost as if it is time itself that I am digging away.\n\nDig Boy Dig\nMikko Lyytinen \n2023",

Nor were they explored by those living in the city above. However, they continued to spawn all sorts of magical beings. Before long, Turris Aquae became a place of healing. The waters were considered holy, the creatures considered good, and the fish were delicacies exported to realms far and wide.\n\nThis NFT changes how it looks based on the time of day. It has a different image for day, night, sunrise, and sunset.\nSize: 2160 × 3840px.",
